<div class="sidenote">1327.</div>

<p>Edward the third of that name, the sonne of Edward the second, and of Isabell the
onelie daughter of Philip le Beau, &amp; sister to Charles the fift king of France, began
his reigne as king of England, his father yet liuing, the 25 daie of Ianuarie, after the
creation 5293, in the yeare of our lord 1327, after the account of them that begin the
yeare at Christmasse, 867 after the comming of the Saxons, 260 after the conquest, the
13 yeare of the reigne of Lewes the fourth then emperour, the seuenth of Charles the fift
king of France, the second of Andronicus Iunior emperour of the east almost ended, and
about the end of the 22 of Robert le Bruce king of Scotland. He was crowned at Westminster
on the day of the Purification of our ladie next insuing, by the hands of Walter
the archbishop of Canturburie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gouernours appointed.</div>

<p>And bicause he was but fourt&eacute;ene yeares of age, so that to gouerne of himselfe he was
not sufficient, it was decr&eacute;ed that twelue of the greatest lords within the realme should
haue the rule and gouernment till he came to more perfect yeares. The names of which
lords were as followeth. The archbishop of Canturburie, the archbishop of Yorke, the
bishops of Winchester and of Hereford, Henrie earle of Lancaster, Thomas Brotherton earle
marshall, Edmund of Woodstoke earle of Kent, Iohn earle of Warren, the lord Thomas
Wake, the lord Henrie Percie, the lord Oliuer de Ingham, &amp; the lord Iohn Ros. These
were sworne of the kings councell, and charged with the gouernement as they would make
answer. But this ordinance continued not long: for the qu&eacute;ene, and the lord Roger
Mortimer tooke the whole rule so into their hands, that both the king and his said councellors
were gouerned onelie by them in all matters both high and low. Neuerthelesse,
although they had taken the regiment vpon them, yet could they not fores&eacute;e the tumults
and vprores that presentlie vpon the yoong kings inthronizing did insue: but n&eacute;eds it
must come to passe that is left written where children weare the crowne, &amp; beare the scepter
in hand,</p>

<div class="sidenote">The franchises of the citie of London confirmed.</div>

<p>He confirmed the liberties and franchises of the citie of London, and granted that the
maior of the same citie for the time being might sit in all places of iudgement within the
liberties thereof for ch&eacute;efe iustice, aboue all other, the kings person onelie excepted;
and that euerie alderman that had b&eacute;ene maior should be iustice of peace through all the
citie of London and countie of Middlesex; and euerie alderman that had not b&eacute;ene maior,
should be iustice of peace within his owne ward. He granted also to the citizens, that
they should not be constreined to go foorth of the citie to anie warres in defense of the
land, and that the franchises of the citie should not be seized from thenceforth into the
kings hands for anie cause, but onelie for treason and rebellion shewed by the whole citie.
Also Southwarke was appointed to be vnder the rule of the citie, and the maior of London
to be bailiffe of Southwarke, and to ordeine such a substitute in the same borough
as pleased him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Records of Burie.</div>

<p>In the first yeare of this kings reigne, we find in records belonging to the abbeie of
S. Edmundsburie in Suffolke, that the inhabitants of that towne raised a sore commotion
against the abbat &amp; moonks of the same abbeie, and that at seuerall times, as first on
the wednesdaie next after the feast of the conuersion of S. Paule, in the said first yeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
of this kings reigne, one Robert Foxton, Richard Draiton, and a great number of other,
assembling themselues togither in warlike order and araie, assaulted the said abbeie, brake
downe the gates, windowes, and doores, entered the house by force, and assailing certeine
moonks and seruants that belonged to the abbat, did beat, wound, and euill intreat them,
brake open a number of chests, coffers, and forssets, tooke out chalices of gold and siluer,
books, vestments, and other ornaments of the church, beside a great quantitie of rich
plate, and other furniture of household, apparell, armour, and other things, beside fiue
hundred pounds in readie coine, &amp; also thr&eacute;e thousand florens of gold.</p>

<p>All these things they tooke and caried awaie, togither with diuerse charters, writings,
&amp; miniments, as thr&eacute;e charters of Knute sometime king of England, foure charters of king
Hardiknute, one charter of king Edward the confessor, two charters of king Henrie the
first, &amp; other two charters of king Henrie the third, which charters concerned as well the
foundation of the same abbeie, as the grants and confirmations of the possessions and liberties
belonging thereto. Also they tooke awaie certeine writings obligatorie, in the
which diuerse persons were bound for the paiement of great summes of monie, and deliuerie
of certeine wines vnto the hands of the said abbat. Moreouer they tooke awaie with
them ten seuerall buls, concerning certeine exemptions and immunities granted to the
abbats and moonks of Burie by sundrie bishops of Rome.</p>

<p>Furthermore, not herewith contented, they tooke Peter Clopton prior of the said abbeie,
and other moonks foorth of the house, and leading them vnto a place called the Leaden
hall, there imprisoned them, till the thursdaie next before the feast of the Purification
of our ladie, and that daie bringing them backe againe into the chapter-house, deteined
them still as prisoners, till they had sealed a writing, conteining that the abbat and conuent
were bound in ten thousand pounds to be paid to Oliuer Kempe and others by them
named. And further, they were constreined to seale a letter of release for all actions,
quarels, debts, transgressions, suits and demands, which the abbat might in anie wise
claime or prosecute against the said Oliuer Kempe and others in the same letters named.</p>

<p>For these wrongs and other, as for that they would not permit the abbats bailiffes and
officers to k&eacute;epe their ordinarie courts as they were accustomed to doo, as well thr&eacute;e daies
in the w&eacute;eke for the market, to wit, mondaie, wednesdaie and fridaie, as the Portman mote
euerie tuesdaie thr&eacute;e w&eacute;eks, and further prohibit them from gathering such tols, customes,
and yearelie rents, as were due to the abbat for certeine tenements in the towne, which
were let to farme, the abbat brought his action against the said Foxton, Draiton, and
others, and hauing it tried by an inquest, on the fridaie next after the feast of saint Lucie
the virgine, in a sessions holden at Burie by Iohn Stonore, Walter Friskney, Robert Maberthorpe,
&amp; Iohn Bousser, by vertue of the kings writ of oier and determiner to them directed,
the offendors were condemned in 40000 pounds, so that the said Richard Draiton,
and others there present in the court, were committed to prison in custodie of the shiriffe
Robert Walkefare, who was commanded also to apprehend the other that were not yet
arrested, if within his bailiwike they might be found, and to haue their bodies before the
said iustices at Burie aforsaid, on thursdaie in Whitsunw&eacute;eke next insuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The second riot.</div>

<p>Beside this, there was an other indictement and action of trespasse found there the same
daie against the said Richard Draiton and others, for a like disorder and riot by them
committed, on the thursday next after the feast of the Purification of our ladie, in the
same first yeare of this king, at what time they did not onelie breake into the abbie, and
beat the abbats men, but also tooke the abbat himselfe, being then at home, with certeine
of his moonks, k&eacute;eping both him and them as prisoners, till the next daie that they were
constreined to seale certeine writings. And amongst other, a charter, in which it was
conteined, that the abbat and his conuent did grant vnto the inhabitants of the towne of
Burie, to be a corporation of themselues, and to haue a common seale with a gild of
merchants and aldermen: also they were compelled to seale another charter, wherein
was conteined a grant to the said inhabitants, that they should haue the custodie of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
towne gates, and likewise the wardship of all pupils and orphans within the same towne,
beside diuerse other liberties.</p>

<p>Moreouer, they were in like manner constreined to seale thr&eacute;e seuerall obligations, in
which the abbat and conuent were bound to the said inhabitants, as to a communaltie of
a corporation, in seauen thousand pounds, as in two thousand by one obligation, and in
two thousand by an other, and in thr&eacute;e thousand by the third obligation: and further
they were driuen to seale a letter of release of all trespasses, and other things that might
be demanded against the said inhabitants, with a generall acquittance of all debts. Beside
this, the said riotous persons tooke at the same time foorth of the abbie great riches, as
well in plate, armor, books, &amp; apparell, as in other things. They also brake downe two
houses or messuages, that belonged to the abbeie, and situate within the towne of Burie:
they also destroied his fish-ponds, and tooke out such store of fish as they found in the
same: they cut downe also thr&eacute;escore ashes there growing on the soile that belonged to
the said abbat, and did manie other great outrages and enormities, so that it was found
by the inquest, that the abbat was damnified to the value of other fortie thousand
pounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The third riot.</div>

<p>These riots may s&eacute;eme gr&eacute;euous and verie strange, but yet the same were not so heinouslie
taken, as an other which the said inhabitants of Burie attempted against the said abbeie
in manner of a plaine commotion, vpon saint Lukes day in the same yeare, at what time
(as by the records of that abbeie it should appeare) both the abbat and his house were
in the kings speciall protection, and the said inhabitants prohibited by his letters to attempt
anie iniurie against him or his conuent. But neuerthelesse we find that not onelie
the inhabitants of Burie, but also a great number of other misgouerned persons, that resorted
to them from places there about, arraied and furnished with horsse, armor and
weapons, after the manner of warre, came and assaulted the abbeie gates, set fire on
them, and burned them with diuerse other houses n&eacute;ere adioining, that belonged to the
abbeie, and continued in that their riotous enterprise all that day and the night following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The manour of Holdernesse barne.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The manour of Westlie burnt.</div>

<p>The same night also they burnt a manor of the abbats called Holdernesse barne, with
two other manors called the Almoners barne, and Haberdone, also the granges that stood
without the south gate, and the manour of Westlie, in which places they burned in corne
&amp; graine, to the value of a thousand pounds. The next daie they entered into the abbeie
court, and burnt all the houses on the north side, as stables, brewhouses, bakehouses,
garners, and other such necessarie houses and conuenient roomes of offices; and on the
other side the court, they burnt certeine houses belonging to the Almonrie. On the next
daie they burned the mote hall, and Bradford hall, with the new hall, and diuerse chambers
and sollers to the same halles annexed, with the chapell of saint Laurence at the end
of the hospitall hall. Also the manor of Eldhall, the manor of Horninger, with all the
corne and graine within and about the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The manour of Fornham burnt.</div>

<p>The next day they burnt the soller of the Sollerer, with a chapell there: also the kitchin,
the larder, and a part of the farmarie. On the thursdaie they burnt the residue of the
farmarie, and the lodging called the blacke lodging, with a chapell of S. Andrew therein.
In executing of all these riotous disorders, one Geffrie Moreman was an aider, who with
diuerse other persons vnknowne, departed foorth of the towne of Burie, and by the assent
of the other his complices he burnt the manor of Fornham. The same day also other of
their companie, as William the sonne of Iames Neketon, Rafe Grubbe, Richard Kerie,
and a great number of other persons vnknowne, by the assent and abbetment of the other
that committed the said disorders, burnt two manors belonging also to the said abbeie in
great Berton, with all the corne and graine there found.</p>

<p>Vpon knowledge had of these great riots, and perillous commotions, there was a commission
directed from the king, vnto Thomas earle of Northfolke high marshall of England,
to Thomas Bardulfe, Robert Morlie, Peter Wedall, Iohn Howard, and Iohn Walkfare,
authorising them with the power of the countesse of Suffolke and Northfolke, to appre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>hend,
trie and punish such lewd disordered persons, and rebellious malefactors, which had
committed such felonious enterprises, to the breach of the kings peace, and dangerous disquieting
of his subiects: but the said commissioners proc&eacute;eded not according to the effect
of their commission in triall of anie felonies by the same persons committed and doone,
but onelie caused them to be indicted of trespasse: albeit Robert Walkfare, and Iohn
Clauer, with their associats iustices of peace, in their sessions holden at Elueden the tuesdaie
next after the feast of the apostles Simon and Iude, in the said first yeare of this K.
Edward the third proc&eacute;eded in such wise against the said malefactors, that Iohn de Berton
cordwainer, Robert Foxton, and a great number of other were indicted of felonie,
for the misdemenours afore mentioned, and the indictements so found were after sent and
presented vnto Iohn Stonore, Walter de Friskenie, Robert Malberthorpe, and Iohn Bousser,
who by vertue of the kings commission of oier and determiner to them directed, sat
at S. Edmundsburie the wednesdaie next after the feast of saint Lucie the virgine; and
then and there sent foorth precepts to the shiriffe, commanding him to apprehend the said
Berton, Foxton, and others, that were indicted of the foresaid felonies, and also to returne
a sufficient iurie to trie vpon their arreignment the said malefactors by order of law, the
fridaie next after the said feast of S. Lucie. Herevpon Alane de Latoner, and Robert
Dalling, with seauent&eacute;ene others, being arreigned, were found guiltie, and suffered death
according to the order appointed for felons.</p>

<p>One Adam Miniot stood mute, and refused to be tried by his countrie, and so was
pressed to death, as the law in such case appointeth. Diuerse other were saued by their
bookes, according vnto the order of clerkes conuict, as Alexander Brid person of Hogeset,
Iohn Rugham person of little Welnetham, Iohn Burton cordwainer, and diuerse other.
Some were repriued, as one woman named Iulian Barbor, who being big bellied was respited,
till she were deliuered of child. Benedict Sio and Robert Russell were repriued,
and committed to the safe k&eacute;eping of the shiriffe, as triers or appeachers (as we tearme
them) of other offenders: and bicause there was not anie as yet attached by their appeales,
they were commanded againe to person. One Robert de Creswell was saued by
the kings letters of speciall pardon, which he had there readie to shew. As for Robert
Foxton, Adam Cokefield, and a great number of other, whome the shiriffe was commanded
to apprehend, he returned that he could not heare of them within the precinct of his
bailiffew&eacute;eke, wherevpon exigents were awarded against them, and the shiriffe was commanded,
that if he might come to attach them, he should not faile but so to doo, and to
haue their bodies there at Burie before the said iustices, the thursdaie in Whitsunw&eacute;eke,
next insuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The common people often deceiued by lewd informations.</div>

<p>Diuerse also were arreigned at the same time of the said felonies, and thereof acquited,
as Michaell Scabaille, Rafe Smeremonger, and others. Ind&eacute;ed those that were found
guiltie, and suffered, were the ch&eacute;efe authors and procurers of the commotion, bearing
others in hand that the abbat had in his custodie a certeine charter, wherein the king
should grant to the inhabitants of the towne of Burie, certeine liberties, whereby it might
appeare that they were fr&eacute;e, and discharged from the paiment of diuerse customes and exactions,
wherevpon the ignorant multitude easilie giuing credit to such surmised tales,
were the sooner induced to attempt such disorders as before are mentioned. &para; Thus
haue y&eacute;e heard all in effect that was doone in this first yeare of king Edward the third
his reigne, by and against those offendors. But bicause we will not interrupt matters of
other yeares with that which followed further of this businesse, we haue thought good to
put the whole that we intend to write thereof here in this place.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Rob. Foxton pardoned.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A priuilege.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Portman mote.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The abbats officers blamed.</div>

<p>Y&eacute;e shall therefore vnderstand, that diuerse of those, against whome exigents were
awarded, came in, and y&eacute;elded their bodies to the shiriffes prison, before they were called
on the fift countie daie. Albeit a great manie there were that came not, and so were
outlawed. Robert Foxton got the kings pardon, and so purchasing foorth a supersedeas,
the suit therevpon against him was staied. The shiriffe therefore in Whitsunw&eacute;eke, in the
second yeare of this kings reigne, made his returne touching Benedict Sio, Robert Russell,
&amp; Iulian Barbor, so that he deliuered them vnto the bailiffes of the libertie of the
abbat of Burie, by reason of an ancient priuilege, which the abbat claimed to belong to
his house. The bailiffes confessed they had receiued the said prisoners, but forsomuch as
they had b&eacute;ene arreigned at a Portman mote, which was vsed to be kept euerie thr&eacute;e
w&eacute;eks, and vpon their arreignment were found guiltie of certeine other felonies by them
committed within the towne of Burie, and therevpon were put to execution, Adam Finchman
the kings attornie there tooke it verie euill, &amp; laid it gr&eacute;euouslie to the charge of the
abbats officers, for their hastie and presumptuous proc&eacute;eding against the said prisoners,
namelie, bicause the said Sio and Russell were repriued, to the end that by their vtterance,
many heinous offenses might haue b&eacute;ene brought to light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A condemnation.</div>

<p>On the same daie, that is to wit, the thursdaie in Whitsunw&eacute;eke, the foresaid Robert
Foxton, and diuerse other came in, and were attached by the shiriffe to answer the abbat
to his action of trespasse, which he brought against them, and putting the matter to the
triall of an inquest, they were condemned in sixtie thousand pounds, to be leuied of their
goods and chattels, vnto the vse of the abbat, and in the meane time they were committed
to prison. But first they made suit that they might be put to their fines for their offenses
committed against the kings peace, and their request in that behalfe was granted, so that
vpon putting in sufficient suerties for their good abearing, their fines were assessed, as
some at more and some at lesse, as the case was thought for to require.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An agr&eacute;em&#x0113;t.</div>

<p>Thus rested the matter a long season after, vntill the fift yeare of this kings reigne, in
which the thursdaie next after the feast of the blessed Trinitie, the K. being himselfe in
person at S. Edmundsburie aforesaid, a finall agr&eacute;ement and concord was concluded betwixt
the said abbat and his conuent on the one partie, and Richard Draiton and others
of the inhabitants of that towne on the other partie, before the right reuerend father in
God Iohn bishop of Winchester and chancellour of England, and the kings iustices Iohn

The effect of which agr&eacute;ement was as followeth.</p>

<p>First, whereas the said abbat had recouered by iudgement before the said Iohn
Stonore and other his associats iustices of oier and determiner in the said towne of Burie,
the summe of seuen score thousand pounds for trespasses to him and his house committed
and doone by the said Richard Draiton, and other the inhabitants of Burie: now at
the desire of the said king, and for other good respects him moouing, he pardoned and
released vnto the said Richard Draiton, and to other the inhabitants of Burie, to their
heires, executors, and assigns the summe of 122333 pounds, eight shillings eight pence,
of the said totall summe of 140000 pounds.</p>

<p>And further the said abbat and conuent granted and agr&eacute;ed for them and their successors,
that if the said Richard Draiton, &amp; other the inhabitants of the said towne of Burie,
or any of them, their heires, executors or assignes, should paie to the said abbat &amp; conuent,
or their successors within twentie yeares next insuing the date of that present agr&eacute;ement,
2000 marks, that is to saie, 100 marks yearelie at the feasts of S. Michaell &amp; Easter, by
euen portions: that then the said Richard &amp; other the inhabitants of the towne of Burie
should be acquited &amp; discharged of 4000 marks, parcell of 17666 pounds, thirt&eacute;ene shillings
foure pence residue behind for euer.</p>

<p>Moreouer, whereas the said abbat and conuent, &amp; the said abbat by himselfe, since the
19 yeare of the reigne of king Edward the second vnto that present time, had sealed certeine
charters, d&eacute;eds, &amp; writings, as well with the proper seale of the abbat, as with the
common seale of the abbat &amp; conuent, if the said Richard and the inhabitants of the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
towne of Burie did restore vnto the said abbat &amp; conuent all the same writings, or take
such order, that neither the abbat nor conuent be impleaded, or in any wise hindered, indamaged
nor molested by force of the same: and further if neither the said Richard, nor
any the inhabitants of the said towne, nor their heires, executors, nor assignes, shall go
about to reuerse the iudgements against them, at the suit of the said abbat, nor shall
s&eacute;eke to impeach the executions of the same iudgements by anie false or forged aquitances
or releases, nor implead nor molest any of the iurie, by whom they were conuict, that then
they and their heires, executors &amp; assignes shall be acquited &amp; discharged of ten thousand

<p>And furthermore, if the said Richard and other the inhabitants of the said towne of Burie,
doo not hereafter maliciouslie rise against the said abbat or conuent, nor s&eacute;eke to vex
them by any conspiracie, confederacie, or by some other secret vniust cause, nor likewise
euill intreat any man by reason of the inditement found against them, nor yet claime to
haue any corporation of themselues within that towne, that then the said Richard, &amp; the
said inhabitants, their heires, successors &amp; assignes, shall remaine acquited and discharged
of all the residue of the said 17666 pounds, thirt&eacute;ene shillings foure pence for euer.
And the said abbat and conuent doo grant for them &amp; their successours, that their intention
is not, that if any singular person of his owne priuate malice, shall rise against the
said abbat and conuent, their successors, moonks, bailiffes, or seruants, to doo them, or
any of them iniurie or displeasure; that those which be not partakers of the offense, shall
be in any wise punished for the same, so that the offendors be not mainteined by any of
the same towne, but that the inhabitants there, doo assist the abbat and conuent their
successours, bailiffes, seruants &amp; officers, that the same offendors may be punished, according
to their demerits, as reason and law shall allow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This might come to passe before the agr&eacute;ement was made in the fift yeare of the kings reigne as aboue is mentioned, and so therevpon he might be restored.</div>

<p>This was the effect of the agr&eacute;ement at length had and made betwixt the abbat and
moonks of Burie on the one part, &amp; the inhabitants of that towne on the other part, and
for the more confirmation therof, it pleased the king to put his seale to the charter conteining
the same agr&eacute;ement. &para; But how soeuer it chanced, it should appeare by such
records as came to the hands of master Iohn Fox, as he alledgeth in the first tome of his
booke of acts and monuments, this agr&eacute;ement was but sorilie kept: for diuerse of the
former offendors, bearing grudge towards the abbat for breaking promise with them at
London, did confederat themselues togither, and priuilie in the night comming to the
manour of Chennington where the abbat then did lie, burst open the gates, and entring
by force, first bound all his seruants, and after they had robbed the house, they tooke the
abbat, and shauing him, secretlie conueied him to London, and there remoouing him from
str&eacute;et to str&eacute;et vnknowne, had him ouer the Thames into Kent, and at length transported
him ouer vnto Dist in Brabant, where they kept him for a time in much penurie, thraldome
and miserie, vntill at length the matter being vnderstood, they were all excommunicate,
first by the archbishop, &amp; after by the pope. At the last, his fr&eacute;ends hauing
knowledge where he was, they found means to deliuer him out of the hands of those
th&eacute;eues, and finallie brought him home with procession, and so he was restored to his
house againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rob. Maners capteine of Norham castell.</div>

<p>Thus much touching those troubles betwixt the townesmen of Burie &amp; the abbat and
moonks there, and now we will returne to other generall matters touching the publike
state of the realme. &para; And first you shall vnderstand, that in the beginning of this kings
reigne the land trulie s&eacute;emed to be blessed of God: for the earth became fruitfull, the aire
temperate, and the sea calme and quiet. This king though he was as yet vnder the
gouernement of other, neuerthelesse he began within a short time to shew tokens of great
towardnesse, framing his mind vnto graue deuises, and first he prepared to make a iornie
against the Scotishmen, the which in his fathers time had doone so manie displeasures to
the Englishmen, and now vpon confidence of his minoritie, ceassed not to inuade the
borders of his realme. And namelie the verie selfe night that followed the day of this
kings coronation, they had thought by skaling to haue stolne the castell of Norham: but
Robert Maners capteine of that place, vnderstanding of their enterprise aforehand by a
Scotishmen of the garison there, so well prouided for their comming, that where sixt&eacute;ene
of them boldlie entred vpon the wall, he slue nine or ten of them and tooke fiue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Beaumont of Heinault.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>This was thought an euill token, that they should still be put to the worsse in this kings
time, sith they had so bad successe in the verie beginning of his reigne: but they continuing
in their malicious purposes, about saint Margarets tide inuaded the land with thr&eacute;e
armies, the earle of Murrey hauing the leading of one of the same armies, and Iames
Douglas of another, and the third was guided by the earle of Mar. King Edward aduertised
hereof, assembled not onelie a great power of Englishmen, but also required Iohn
lord Beaumont de Heinault, whome he had latelie sent home right honorablie rewarded
for his good assistance, to come againe into England, with certeine bands of men at armes,
and he should receiue wages and good interteinement for them. The lord Beaumont, as
one that loued d&eacute;eds of armes, was glad to accomplish king Edwards request: and so
therevpon with seauen hundred men at armes, or fiue hundred (as Froissart saith) came
ouer into England againe, to serue against the Scots.</p>

<p>The generall assemblie of the armie was appointed to be at Yorke, and thither came the
said lord Beaumont with his people, and was ioifullie receiued of the king and his lords.
Here whilest not onelie the Scotish ambassadours (which had b&eacute;ene sent to treat of peace,
were heard to tell their message) but also whilest the councell tooke some leisure in debating
the matter how to guide their enterprise, which they had now in hand: vpon
Trinitie sundaie, it chanced that there arose contention within the citie of Yorke, betwixt
the English archers, and the strangers, which the lord Beaumont of Heinault had brought
with him, insomuch that fighting togither there were slaine to the number of foure score
persons of those archers, which were buried within the church of saint Clement in Fosgate.
&para; Some write that there were slaine to the number of thr&eacute;e hundred Englishmen: yet
bicause the Henuiers came to aid the king, their peace was cried vpon paine of life. And
further, it was found by an inquest of the citie, that the quarrel was begun by the Englishmen,
the which (as some write) were of the Lincolneshire men, of those that sometime
belonged to the Spensers, and to the earle of Arundell, so that there was cause, whie they
bare euill will to the Henuiers which had aided (as ye haue heard) to bring the said earle
and Spensers to their confusion.</p>

<p>In this meane time the Scots being entred into England, had doone much hurt, and
were come as farre as Stanop parke in Wiredale: and though they had sent their ambassadours
to treat with the king and his councell for peace, yet no conclusion followed of
their talke. At the same time, bicause the English souldiers of this armie were cloathed
all in cotes and hoods embrodered with floures and branches verie s&eacute;emelie, and vsed
to nourish their beards: the Scots in derision thereof made a rime, which they
fastened vpon the church doores of saint Peter toward Stangate, conteining this that followeth.</p>

<p>The king when he saw it was but a vaine thing to staie anie longer in communication
with the ambassadors about peace, departed from Yorke with his puissant armie, and
getting knowledge how the Scots were closelie lodged in the woods of Stanop parke, he
came and stopped all the passages, so it was thought that he should haue had them at his
pleasure, but through treason (as was after reported) of the lord Roger Mortimer, after
that the Scots had b&eacute;ene kept within their lodgings for the space of fift&eacute;ene daies, till they
were almost famished, they did not onelie find a waie out, but about two hundred of them
vnder the leading of the lord William Douglas, assailing that part of the English campe
where the kings tent stood, in the night season, missed not much of either taking the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
or sleieng him: and hauing doone hurt inough otherwise, as in the Scotish chronicle is also

<p>It is said, that Henrie earle of Lancaster, and Iohn the lord Beaumont of Heinault
would gladlie haue passed ouer the water of Wire, to haue assailed the Scots, but the
earle of March through counsell of the lord Mortimer, pretending to haue right to the
leading of the fore ward, and to the giuing of the first onset, would not suffer them.
Howsoeuer it was the king missed his purpose, and right pensiue therefore, brake vp his
field, and returned vnto London. &para; Walter bishop of Canturburie departed this life in
Nouember, and then Simon Mepham was aduanced to the gouernement of that s&eacute;e. The
lord Beaumont of Heinault was honorablie rewarded for his paines and trauell, and then
licenced to returne into his countrie, where he had not b&eacute;ene long, but that through his
means then (as some write) the marriage was concluded betw&eacute;ene king Edward, and the
ladie Philip daughter to William earle of Heinault, and n&eacute;ece to the said lord Beaumont,
who had the charge to s&eacute;e hir brought ouer thither into England about Christmasse:
where in the citie of Yorke vpon the &eacute;euen of the Conuersion of saint Paule, being

<p>In the second yeare of his reigne, about the feast of Pentecost, king Edward held a
parlement at Northampton, at the which parlement by euill and naughtie counsell, whereof
the lord Roger Mortimer and the qu&eacute;ene mother bare the blame, the king concluded with
the Scotish king both an vnprofitable and a dishonorable peace. For first, he released to
the Scots their fealtie and homage. Also he deliuered vnto them certeine old ancient
writings, sealed with the seales of the king of Scots, and of diuerse lords of the land both
spirituall and temporall: amongst the which was that indenture, which they called Ragman,
with manie other charters and patents, by the which the kings of Scotland were
bound as feodaries vnto the crowne of England; at which season also there were deliuered
certeine iewels, which before time had b&eacute;ene woone from the Scots by the kings of England,
and among other, the blacke crosier or rood is speciallie named.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A marriage concluded.</div>

<p>And not onelie the king by his sinister councell lost such right and title as he had to the

and barons, and other men of England that had anie lands or rents within Scotland, lost
their right in like manner, except they would dwell vpon the same lands, and become liege
men to the king of Scotland. Herevpon was there also a marriage concluded betwixt
Dauid Bruce the sonne of Robert Bruce king of Scotland, and the ladie Iane sister to king
Edward, which of diuerse writers is surnamed Ione of the tower, and the Scots surnamed hir
halfe in derision, Ione Makepeace. This marriage was solemnised at Berwike vpon the
daie of Marie Magdalen. The qu&eacute;ene with the bishops of Elie and Norwich, the earle
Warren, the lord Mortimer, and diuerse other barons of the land, and a great multitude
of other people were present at that marriage, which was celebrate with all the honour that
might be.</p>

<p>After the quindene of saint Michaell, king Edward held a parlement at Salisburie, in
which the lord Roger Mortimer was created earle of March, the lord Iohn of Eltham the
kings brother was made earle of Cornwall, and the lord Iames Butler of Ireland earle of
Ormond, who about the same time had married the earle of Herefords daughter. But the
earle of March tooke the most part of the rule of all things perteining either to the king or
realme into his owne hands: so that the whole gouernment rested in a manner betwixt the
qu&eacute;ene mother and him. The other of the councell that were first appointed, were in
manner displaced; for they bare no rule to speake of at all, which caused no small grudge
to arise against the qu&eacute;ene and the said earle of March, who mainteined such ports, and
kept among them such retinue of seruants, that their prouision was woonderfull, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
caused to be taken vp, namelie for the qu&eacute;ene, at the kings price, to the sore oppression

<p>There was like to haue growen great variance betwixt the qu&eacute;ene and Henrie earle of
Lancaster, by reason that one sir Thomas Wither, a knight perteining to the said earle of
Lancaster, had slaine Robert Holland, who had betraied sometime Thomas earle of Lancaster,
and was after committed to prison by earle Henries means, but the qu&eacute;ene had
caused him to be set at libertie, and admitted him as one of hir councell. The qu&eacute;ene
would haue had sir Thomas Wither punished for the murther, but earle Henrie caused him
to be kept out of the waie, so that for these causes and other, Henrie the earle of Lancaster
went about to make a rebellion, and the qu&eacute;ene hauing knowledge thereof, sought to
apprehend him: but by the mediation of the earles Marshall and Kent, the matter was
taken vp, and earle Henrie had the kings peace granted him for the summe of eleuen
thousand pounds, which he should haue paid, but he neuer paid that fine, though it was so
assessed at the time of the agr&eacute;ement.</p>

of his reigne, about the Ascension tide, king Edward went ouer into France, and comming
to the French king Philip de Valois, as then being at Amiens, did there his homage vnto
him for the duchie of Guien (as in the French historie appeareth.) &para; The same yeare
Simon the archbishop of Canturburie held a synod at London, wherein all those were excommunicated

at Winchester, during the which, Edmund of Woodstoke earle of Kent the kings
vncle was arrested the morrow after saint Gregories day, and being arreigned vpon certeine
confessions and letters found about him, he was found giltie of treason. There were diuerse
in trouble about the same matter, for the earle vpon his open confession before
sundrie lords of the realme, declared that not onelie by commandement from the pope, but
also by the setting on of diuerse nobles of this land (whome he named) he was persuaded
to indeuour himselfe by all waies and meanes possible how to deliuer his brother king
Edward the second out of prison, and to restore him to the crowne, whome one Thomas
Dunhed, a frier of the order of preachers in London, affirmed for certeine to be aliue,
hauing (as he himselfe said) called vp a spirit to vnderstand the truth thereof, and so
what by counsell of the said frier, and of thr&eacute;e other friers of the same order, he had purposed
to worke some meane how to deliuer him, and to restore him againe to the kingdome.
Among the letters that were found about him, disclosing a great part of his practise, some
there were, which he had written and directed vnto his brother the said king Edward, as by

the space of two moneths before, and thr&eacute;e moneths after, there fell exc&eacute;eding great raine,
so that through the great intemperancie of weather, corne could not ripen, by reason

the seunt&eacute;enth day of October within the castell of Notingham, where the king with the
two qu&eacute;enes, his mother and his wife, and diuerse other were as then lodged. And
though the keies of the castell were dailie and knightlie in the custodie of the said earle of
March, and that his power was such, as it was doubted how he might be arrested (for he

<p>Sir Hugh Trumpington or Turrington (as some copies haue) that was one of his ch&eacute;efest
fr&eacute;ends with certeine other were slaine, as they were about to resist against the lord
Montacute, and his companie in taking of the said earle. The manner of his taking I
passe ouer, bicause of the diuersitie in report thereof by sundrie writers. From Notingham
he was sent vp to London with his sonne the lord Roger or Geffrey de Mortimer,
sir Simon Bereford, and the other prisoners, where they were committed to prison in the
tower. Shortlie after was a parlement called at Westminster, ch&eacute;efelie (as was thought)
for reformation of things disordered through the misgouernance of the earle of March.
But whosoeuer was glad or sorie for the trouble of the said earle, suerlie the qu&eacute;ene
mother tooke it most heauilie aboue all other, as she that loued him more (as the fame
went) than stood well with hir honour. For as some write, she was found to be with child
by him. They kept as it were house togither, for the earle to haue his prouision the
better cheape, laid his penie with hirs, so that hir takers serued him as well as they did
hir both of vittels &amp; cariages. Of which misvsage (all regard to honour and estimation
neglected) euerie subiect spake shame. For their manner of dealing, tending to such
euill purposes as they continuallie thought vpon, could not be secret from the eies of the
people. And their offense h&eacute;erein was so much the more heinous, bicause they were
persons of an extraordinarie degr&eacute;e, and were the more narrowlie marked of the multitude
or common people,</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of March attainted.</div>

<p>But now in this parlement holden at Westminster he was attainted of high treason expressed
in fiue articles, as in effect followeth.</p>

<p>1 First, he was charged that he had procured Edward of Carnaruan the kings father
to be murthered in most heinous and tyrannous maner within the castell of Berklie.</p>

<p>2 Secondlie, that the Scots at Stanop parke through his means escaped.</p>

<p>3 Thirdlie, that he receiued at the hands of the lord Iames Dowglas, at that time
generall of the Scots, great summes of monie to execute that treason, and further to conclude
the peace vpon such dishonorable couenants as was accorded with the Scots at the
parlement of Northampton.</p>

<p>4 Fourthlie, that he had got into his hands a great part of the kings treasure, and had
wasted and consumed it.</p>

<p>5 Fiftlie, that he had impropried vnto him diuerse wards that belonged vnto the king:
and had b&eacute;ene more priuie with qu&eacute;ene Isabell the kings mother, than stood either with

insuing, he was at London drawne and hanged, at the common place of execution, called
in those daies The elmes, &amp; now Tiborne, as in some bookes we find. His bodie remained
two daies and two nights on the gallowes, and after taken downe was deliuered to the
friers minors, who buried him in their church the morrow after he was deliuered to them,
with great pompe and funerall exequies, although afterwards he was taken vp and carried

<p>In the fift yeare of K. Edwards reigne, Edward Balioll came foorth of France
into England, and obteined such fauour through the assistance of the lord Henrie
Beaumont, the lord Dauid of Strabogie earle of Athole, the lord Geffrey de Mowbraie,
the lord Walter Cumin, and others, that king Edward granted him licence
to make his prouision in England to passe into Scotland, with an armie of men to
attempt the recouerie of his right to the crowne of Scotland, with condition that if he
recouered it, he should acknowledge to hold it of the king of England as superiour lord
of Scotland. The comming awaie of Edward Balioll out of France is diuerslie reported
by writers: some saie that he was aided by the French king, whose sister he had married:
and other saie, that he being in prison in France, for the escape of an Englishman, one
Iohn Barnabie esquier, which had slaine a Frenchman by chance of quarelling in the
towne of Dampierre, where the same Barnabie dwelled with the said Edward Balioll, so
it came to passe that the lord Henrie Beaumont hauing occasion of businesse with the
French king, that fauoured him well, came ouer to France, and there vnderstanding of
Baliols imprisonment, procured his deliuerance, and brought him ouer into England, and
caused him to remaine in secret wise at the manor of Sandhall vpon Ouse in Yorkeshire
with the ladie Vescie, till he had purchased the kings grant for him to make his prouision
of men of war and ships within the English dominions.</p>

and come togither, being in all not past fiue hundred men of armes, and about two thousand
archers, and other footmen, he tooke the sea at Rauenspurgh in Yorkeshire, and
from thence directing his course northward, he arriued at length in Scotland, where he
atchiuing great victories (as in the Scotish chronicle y&eacute;e may read more at large) was

his brother in law king Dauid that had married his sister (as before ye haue heard.)
Ind&eacute;ed at the first he was not verie readie to grant their suit that mooued it, but at length
was contented to dissemble the matter, in hope that if Edward Balioll had good successe,
he should then recouer that againe, which by the conclusion of peace during his
minoritie, he had through euill counsell resigned out of his hands. The Scots neuerthelesse
in December chased their new king Edward Balioll out of Scotland, so that he was
faine to retire into England, and celebrated the feast of the Natiuitie at Carleill, in the
house of the friers minors, and the morrow after being S. Stephans day, he went into Westmerland,
where of the lord Clifford he was right honorablie receiued, to whome he then

Finallie about the t&eacute;enth day of March, hauing assembled a power of Englishmen and
Scotishmen, he entred Scotland, and besieged the towne of Berwike, during the which

entred England by Carleill, dooing much mischiefe in Gillesland, by burning, killing, robbing

concluded betwixt him and Dauid Bruce, the sonne of Robert Bruce that had
married his sister, &amp; therfore tooke it to be lawfull for him to aid his coosen Edward

Berwike, togither with his brother Iohn of Eltham earle of Cornewall, and other noble
men, s&eacute;eking by all meanes possible how to win the towne: and finallie discomfited an

leauing the lord Thomas Bourgh his deputie in that countrie, passed ouer with an armie
into Scotland, to aid the king, who (as ye haue heard) was there the same time in person.
And so by the king on one side, and by the Irishmen on an other, Scotland was
subdued, and restored vnto Balioll, who the morrow after the octaues of the Natiuitie of
our ladie, held a parlement at saint Iohns towne, in the which he reuoked and made void
all acts, which the late king of Scots Robert Bruce had inacted or made: and further

After Candlemas the king of England repaired towards Yorke, there to hold

Edward Balioll doubting to be surprised by his aduersaries, could not come, yet he sent
the lord Henrie de Beaumont, and the lord William de Montacute, to make excuse for
him. The king of England passing further into the north parts, held his Whitsuntide at
Newcastell vpon Tine, with great roialtie: and shortlie after, Edward Balioll king of
Scots came thither, and vpon the ninet&eacute;enth daie of Iune made his homage vnto the king
of England, and sware vnto him fealtie in the presence of a great number of Nobles and
gentlemen there assembled, as to his superiour and chiefe lord of the realme of Scotland,
binding himselfe by that oth, to hold the same realme of the king of England, his heires

fiue counties next adioining vnto the borders of England, as Berwike and Rocksburgh,
Peplis, and Dunfres, the townes of Hadington and Gedworth with the castell, the forrests
of Silkirke, Etherike, and Gedworth, so as all these portions should be cl&eacute;erelie
separated and put apart from the crowne of Scotland, and annexed vnto the crowne of
England for euer. And these things were confirmed and roborated with oth, scepter, and
witnesse sufficient.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inundation of the sea.</div>

b&eacute;ene expelled from the same: and now they did their homage vnto the king of Scotland
for those lands as apperteined. &para; Immediatlie after, the king of England called a councell
of his lords spirituall and temporall at Notingham, commanding them to m&eacute;et him
there about the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Iulie, there to consult with him of weightie causes concerning
the state of the realme. This yeare on saint Clements daie at night, which fell on
the thr&eacute;e and twentith of Nouember, through a maruellous inundation &amp; rising of the sea
all alongst by the coasts of this realme, but especiallie about the Thames, the sea bankes
or walles were broken and borne downe with violence of the water, and infinite numbers
of beasts and cattell drowned, fruitfull grounds and pastures were made salt marishes,

that the king of England was not in all things well pleased with him, thought good before
he set forward on that iournie to vnderstand his meaning, and thervpon sent eftsoones vnto
him other ambassadours. These ambassadours arriued here in England and had audience,

wherein he tooke order for his iournie into Scotland, had a tenth and a fift&eacute;enth granted

there till the feast of saint Katharine, and then entring into Scotland, came to
Rockesburgh, where he repared the castell which had b&eacute;ene aforetime destroied. After
the third daie of Christmasse was past, the king of England entred into Ethrike forrest,
beating it vp and downe, but the Scots would not come within his reach: wherevpon he

<p>Before the feast of the Ascension, the king of England sent forward the king of Scots,
the earles of Lancaster, Warwike, Oxford, and Anegos, and diuerse lords and capteins
with an armie, the which after Whitsuntide entring into Scotland, passed ouer the Scotish
sea, and comming to saint Iohns towne (which the Scots had burnt, despairing to defend it
against the English power) they set in hand to fortifie it, compassing it with d&eacute;epe diches
and a strong rampier of earth. &para; About the same time the king called a parlement at
Northampton, where leauing the prelats and other to treat of such matters as were proponed,
he himselfe rode northwards, and comming to Berwike, tooke with him a small
band of men of armes, and setting forward, hasted foorth till he came to saint Iohns towne,
where he found the king of Scots, and other his nobles greatlie woondering at his comming
thither so vnlooked for. After he had rested there a little, he tooke with him part of the
armie, and passed forward ouer the mounteines of Scotland euen vnto Elgen in Murrey
and Inuernes, further by manie miles than euer his grandfather had gone.</p>

<p>In his returne he burnt the towne of Aberden, in reuenge of the death of a right valiant
knight called sir Thomas Rosselin, that comming thither by sea tooke land there, and was
slaine by the enimies: he burnt diuerse other townes and places in this voiage, spoiling and
wasting the countries where he came, not finding anie to resist him. About Lammas the
earle of Cornewall with the power of Yorkeshire and Northumberland, and the lord
Anthonie Lucie with the Cumberland and Westmerland men entred Scotland, and destroied
the west parts, as Carrike, and other which obeied not the Balioll. The lord William
Douglas still coasted the Englishmen, dooing to them what damage he might. At length
this armie loden with preies and spoile returned home, but the earle of Cornewall with his
owne retinue came through to saint Iohns towne, where he found the king being returned
thither fr&#x014D; his iournie which he had made beyond the mounteins. The king staied not
long there, but leauing the king of Scots with his companie in that towne, he went to
Striueling, where, on the plot of ground vpon which the destroied castell had stood, he
built an other fortresse, called a Pile. And now, bicause he had spent a great deale of
treasure in those warres of Scotland, he summoned a parlement to be holden at Notingham,
in which there was granted to him a tenth of the cleargie, and likewise of the
citizens and burgesses of good towns, and a fift&eacute;enth of other that dwelt foorth of cities and
boroughes.</p>

<p>About the latter end of October, Iohn of Eltham earle of Cornewall the kings brother
departed this life at saint Iohns towne in Scotland: his bodie was afterwards conueied to
Westminster, &amp; there buried with all solemne funerals. The Scotish writers affirme that
he was slaine by his brother king Edward for the crueltie he had vsed in the west parts of
Scotland, in sleaing such as for safegard of their liues fled into churches. Moreouer, in
December there deceassed at S. Iohns towne aforesaid, Hugh de Fresnes, that in right of
the countesse of Lincolne was intituled earle of Lincolne. He died of the flix, or (as was
said) through excessiue cold, which in those quarters in that cold time of the yeare sore
afflicted the English people. &para; In the meane time, about the feast of saint Luke the
euangelist, the king went with an armie into Scotland toward the castell of Bothuille, and
comming thither repared the same, which by the Scots had latelie before b&eacute;ene
destroied. The baron Stafford at the same time comming towards the king with a power of
men, took Dowglas Dale in his waie, taking in the same a great preie of cattell and other
things.</p>

<p>Before Christmasse the king returned into England, but the king of Scots remained all
the winter in saint Iohns towne with a sober companie. When the king had setled the state
of Scotland vnder the gouernement of the Balioll, those Scotishmen which tooke part with
the Balioll, ordeined as it were in recompense of king Edwards friendship a statute, whereby
they bound themselues to the said king Edward and his heires kings of England, that they
should aid and assist him against all other princes: and whensoeuer it chanced that either
he or any king of England being rightfull inheritor, had any wars against any prince, either
within the land or without, the Scotishmen of their owne proper costs and expenses should
find thr&eacute;e hundred horssemen, &amp; a thousand footmen well and sufficientlie arraied for the
warre, the which thirt&eacute;ene hundred men the Scots should wage for a whole yeare: &amp; if
the king of England ended not his warres within the yeare, then he to giue wages to the
said number of thirt&eacute;ene hundred Scots, as he dooth to other of his souldiers and men of
warre. There be that write, that the king of England should not onelie fortifie saint
Iohns towne about this time, as before is mentioned, but also saint Andrews, Cowper,
Aberdine, Dunfermeling, with certeine other castels, leauing garisons of men in the same.
But for so much as ye may read sufficientlie of those troubles, in Scotland; and of the
returne of king Dauid foorth of France, and how his realme was recouered out of the
Baliols hands in the Scotish chronicles: we n&eacute;ed not here to make anie long discourse

<p>The qu&eacute;ene was deliuered of hir second sonne at Hatfield, who was therfore named
William of Hatfield, who liued but a short time, departing this world when he was but
yoong. The king being returned home out of Scotland, sought by all waies possible how
to recouer monie, both to supplie his charges for the Scotish wars, and also to furnish the
other wars which he meant to take in hand against the French king: he got so much into
his hands (as it is reported by writers) that it was verie scant and hard to come by throughout
the whole realme: by reason of which scarsitie and want of monie, or vpon some
other necessarie cause, vittels, and other chaffer and merchandize were exc&eacute;eding cheape:
for at London a quarter of wheat was sold for two shillings, a fat oxe for six shillings eight
pence, a fat sh&eacute;epe for six pence or eight pence, halfe a doozen of pigeons for one penie, a
fat goose for two pence, a pig for one penie, and so all other vittels after the like rate.</p>

<p>This yeare was the warre proclaimed betwixt England and France, ch&eacute;efelie by the procurement
of the lord Robert Dartois, a Frenchman, as then banished out of France, vpon
occasion of a claime by him made vnto the earledome of Artois. This lord Robert after
he was banished France, fled ouer vnto king Edward, who gladlie receiued him and made
him earle of Richmond. &para; All the goods of the Italians were by the kings commandement
this yeare confiscate to his vse, and so likewise were the goods of the moonks of the
Cluniake and Cisterceaux orders. &para; This yeare also a comet or blasing starre appeared,
with long and terrible streames passing from it. In the eleauenth yeare of his reigne, the
king held a parlement at Westminster, about the time of Lent, during the which, of the
earledome of Cornewall he made a duchie, and gaue it vnto his eldest sonne Edward, that
was then earle of Chester, whom also (as some write) he created at the same time prince
of Wales.</p>

<p>Moreouer in reward of seruice, there were six noble men at this parlement aduanced to the

earle of Derbie, or after some writers, earle of Leicester; William Bohun was created earle
of Northampton, William Montacute earle of Salisburie, Hugh Audeley earle of Glocester,
William Clinton earle of Huntingdon, and Robert Vfford earle of Suffolke. This creation
was on the second sundaie in Lent, and the same day were twentie knights made, whose

<p>It was also ordeined by the aduise of this parlement, that Henrie of Lancaster newlie

But Richard Southwell saith, that the earle of Salisburie, and not the earle of Derbie
was appointed to go into Gascoine at that time, and the earle of Warwike into Scotland.
Moreouer in this parlement it was enacted that no wooll of the English growth should go
foorth of the land, but be here wrought and made in cloath: and further an act was
ordeined for receiuing of strangers that were clothworkers, and order taken, that fit and
conuenient places should be assigned foorth to them where to inhabit, with manie priuileges
and liberties, and that they should haue wages and stipends allowed them, till they were so

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Bothuile taken.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Eustace Maxwell.</div>

<p>The Scots this yeare tooke the castell of Bothuile by surrender, so as the Englishmen
that were within it, departed with their liues and goods saued. Diuerse other castels and
fortresses were taken by the Scots in Fife, and in other parts, but the countrie of Galloway
was by them speciallie sore afflicted, bicause the people there held with their lord Edward
Balioll. Herevpon it was agr&eacute;ed in this last parlement, that the earle of Warwike being
appointed to go thither, should haue with him the power beyond Trent northwards. But
when about the Ascension tide the Scots had besieged the castell of Striueling, the king of
England in person hasted thitherwards, of whose approach the Scots no sooner vnderstood,
but that streightwaies they brake vp their siege, and departed thence: the king therefore
returned backe into the south parts. About the same time sir Eustace de Maxwell knight,
lord of Carlauerocke, reuolted from Edward Balioll vnto Dauid le Bruse his side, and so
that part dailie increased, and also the warre continued, with damage inough vnto both
parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike inuadeth Scotland.</div>

<p>In the beginning of September the earle of Warwike with an armie entred Scotland by
Berwike, and the lord Thomas de Wake, and the lord Clifford, with the bishop of Carleill
accompanied with the Westmerland and Cumberland men, entred by Carleill, and within
two daies after met with the earle of Warwike, as before it was appointed, and so ioining
togither, they passed forwards, spoiling and wasting Teuidale, Mofeteidale, and Nidesdale.
The lord Anthonie Lucie with a part of the armie entred into Galloway, and after he had
wasted that countrie, he returned to the armie, which by reason of the exc&eacute;eding great weat
that fell in that season, they could not k&eacute;epe on their iournie into Douglasdale, and to Aire,
as they had appointed: but hauing remained in Scotland twelue daies, they returned
altogither vnto Carleill. Edward Balioll was not with them in this iournie, but remained
still in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The K. practiseth with y<sup>e</sup> Flemings.</div>

<p>The Scots in reuenge hereof made diuerse rodes into England, withdrawing still with
their prey and booties, before the English power could assemble to giue them battell.
About Alhallontide, the Scots besieged the castell of Edenburgh, but the bishop of Carleill,
the lord Randoll Dacres of Gillesland, with the power of the counties of Cumberland
and of Westmerland, and the king of Scots Edward Balioll, with the lord Anthonie Lucie,
and such companie as they brought from Berwike, m&eacute;eting at Rockesburgh, marched
foorth vnto Edenburgh, and chasing the Scots from the siege, tooke order for the safe
k&eacute;eping of the castell from thencefoorth, and returned into England. In this meane time
things happened so well to the purpose of king Edward, that by practise he alienated the
hearts of the Flemings from the obedience of their earle, being altogither an earnest fr&eacute;end
to the French king. He therefore vnderstanding the minds of his people, sought to winne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span>
them by some gentle treatie, and so did euen at the first, concluding an agr&eacute;ement with
them of Gaunt, which were fullie at a point to haue entred into league with the king of
England, as with him whose fr&eacute;endship by reason of the traffike of merchandize, (and
namelie of the English wools) they knew to be more necessarie for their countrie than the
French kings.</p>

<p>Although by the helpe of the bishop of Tournie the earle of Flanders caused them to
staie from concluding or ioining in anie such bonds of amitie with the king of England for
that time, yet he doubted the arriuall of some power out of England, and therevpon
appointed his bastard brother Guie of Rijckenburgh, and certeine other noble men and
capteins, with a crue of men of warre to lie in the Ile of Cadsant, to defend the passage
there, and to s&eacute;e that no English ships should come or go that waie by the seas: whereof
the king of England being aduertised, sent thither the earle of Derbie, the lord Lewes
Beauchampe, the lord Reginald Cobham, also the lord William sonne to the earle of
Warwike, the lord Walter de Mannie an Hanneuier, and other lords, knights, and capteins,
with a power of fiue hundred men of armes, and two thousand archers, the which
comming to the foresaid Ile of Cadsant, found the Flemings, about fiue thousand in number,
readie arranged on the towne dikes and sands, in purpose to defend the entrie, which
they did a certeine space right valiantlie: but in the end they were discomfited, and thr&eacute;e
thousand of them slaine in the str&eacute;ets, hauen, and houses. Sir Guie the bastard of Flanders
was taken with diuerse other knights and gentlemen, the towne was burnt, and the
goods with the prisoners were carried into England. This chanced on a sundaie the daie
before the feast of saint Martine in Nouember. Where the lord Walter de Mannie might
haue had 11 thousand pounds sterling for the ransome of the said sir Guie, and other prisoners,
the king bought them of him in the fouret&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne for eight thousand
pounds sterling, as by records in the tower it appeareth.</p>

<p>About the feast of saint Martine in winter, there came vnto London two cardinals, sent

of Canturburie, with the bishops of Winchester, Elie, Chichester, Couentrie, &amp; the
c&#x014D;moners of the citie of London met them on Shooters hill. The duke of Cornewall with
the earle of Surrie, and manie other of the nobilitie receiued them a mile without the
citie. The king himselfe receiued them at the lesser hall doore of his palace at Westminster,
and brought them into the painted chamber, where they declared their message:
wherevpon the king caused a parlement to be summoned at London, to begin the morrow
after Candlemasse day. The king held his Christmasse at Gildford, and within the octaues
of the same feast he tooke his iournie towards Scotland, or rather (as other haue)
he sent thither the earles of Salisburie, Glocester, Derbie, and Anegos, with thr&eacute;e barons,
the lords Percie, Neuill, and Stafford, the which with twentie thousand men besieged the
castell of Dunbar.</p>

<p>This siege began euen in the beginning of the twelfth yeare of king Edwards reigne, and
continued for the space of ninet&eacute;ene w&eacute;eks, with small gaine and lesse honour to the Englishmen,
in so much that the same brake vp vnder a colour of a truce, when there was no
hope of winning the place, and that the noble men that laie there at siege, hasted to make
an end, that they might attend the king in his iournie ouer into Brabant. The morrow
after Candlemasse day the parlement began, in which there was a grant made to the king
by the laitie of the one halfe of their woolles through the whole realme for the next summer,
which he receiued, and likewise he leuied of the cleargie the whole, causing them to paie
nine marks of euerie sacke of the best wooll. But after the rate of the one halfe he tooke
in whose hands so euer it was found, aswell merchants as others. After this, he tooke a
fift&eacute;enth of all the communaltie of his realme in wooll, the price of euerie stone containing
fouret&eacute;ene pounds rated at two shillings. The one and twentith of March the two cardinals
tooke the sea at Douer, and in their companie went ouer the archbishop of Canturburie,
the bishop of Durham to treat of a peace, if by any good means the two kings might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
be made fr&eacute;ends. But as it appeared, their trauell was in vaine, for although they abode

auailed, as by that which followeth is most manifest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siger de Curtrey.</div>

<p>The Flemings that fauoured king Edward, were put in such comfort by the late victorie
obteined by the Englishmen in the Ile of Cadsant, that falling to their former practise, one
Iaques or Iacob van Arteueld an honimaker of the towne of Gant, was chosen amongst
them to be as it were the defender of the people, and namelie of the weauers, and other
clothworkers. Finallie, his authoritie grew so hugelie amongst all the whole number of
the commons in Flanders, that he might doo more with them than their earle; and yet the
earle to reconcile the people to his fauour, ceassed not to vse all courteous means towards
them that he could deuise, as releasing customes and duties of monie, pardoning offenses,
forfeitures, and other such like, but all would not auaile him. The king of England had
so woon them by the meanes of the said Iaques van Arteueld, that in the end Iohn archbishop
of Canturburie, &amp; Richard the bishop of Durham, came into Flanders as ambassadors
from king Edward, and trauelled so earnestlie to draw the Flemings vnto an amitie
with their master king Edward, that finallie a league was concluded betwixt the countrie of
Flanders, and the said king at Gant, in the presence of the earle of Gelderland, as then
being there. The ch&eacute;efe authors of this league were the said Iaques van Arteueld, and a
noble man of Flanders, called Siger de Curtrey.</p>

<p>But this Siger being immediatlie after apprehended by the earle of Flanders, was put to
death. Which act procured the earle so much hatred of the people, that shortlie after
comming to Bruges, and attempting to force the towne to his will, he was forced himselfe to
fl&eacute;e from thence, for otherwise he had b&eacute;ene either taken or slaine; the commons of the
towne &amp; namelie the fullers, of whome he had slaine some there in the str&eacute;ets, rose so fast
vpon him. Herevpon fl&eacute;eing home to his house, he tooke his wife, and a sonne which he
had, and fled with them into France, so forsaking his countrie which was now gouerned by
Iaques van Arteueld, as though he had b&eacute;ene immediatlie lord thereof. After this, the
earle returned home againe, as it were with the French kings commission, to persuade the
Flemings to renounce the league concluded with the king of England: but he could bring
nothing to passe, but was still in danger to haue b&eacute;ene arrested and staied of his owne subiects,
both at Gant and in other places, but namelie at Dixmue, where if he had not made
the more hast awaie, he had b&eacute;ene taken by them of Bruges. Amongst other of his stuffe
which he left behind him in that hastie departure, his signet was forgotten, and not missed
till he came to saint Omers, whither he fled for his safegard.</p>

England, the marques of Gulike with certeine noble men of England, and also certeine of
the duke of Gelderland his councell, the which marques was made at that time an earle, &amp;
the earle of Gelderland was made duke. This duke of Gelderland named Reginald had
married the ladie Isabell sister of king Edward, and therefore in fauour of the king his
brother in law, trauelled most earnestlie to procure him all the fr&eacute;ends within the empire
that he could make.</p>

<p>The princes and lords then with whom king Edward was alied and confederated at that
time, I find to be these; the dukes of Brabant and Gelderland, the archbishop of Cullen,
the marquesse of Gulike, sir Arnold de Baquehen, and the lord of Valkenburgh, who
all promised to defie the French king, in the king of Englands quarrell, and to serue him
with notable numbers of men, where and whensoeuer it should please him to appoint.
The aliance of the earle of Heinault first procured the king of England all these fr&eacute;ends,
vnto the which earle he had sent ouer the bishop of Lincolne and other in ambassage, immediatlie
after that he had resolued to make warres against France, by the counsell and
aduise of sir Robert Dartois, as in the French historie more plainlie appeareth. In

which was named Lionell. &para; The king of England earnestlie followed his businesse, and
had manie treaties with his fr&eacute;ends and confederats, till at length he made sure to him the
fr&eacute;endship of all those townes &amp; countries, which lie betwixt France and the riuer of

<p>In this twelfth yeare of king Edwards reigne at a councell holden at Northampton by
the duke of Cornewall, lord warden of England in absence of the king his brother, and
by manie of the prelats and barons of the realme, there was granted to the king a subsidie
in wooll, to the great burthen of the commons: but for so much as the cleargie of the
land was not present at that councell, it was ordeined that they should be called, and so
they assembled in a conuocation at London the first day of October, in which the cleargie
granted to the king a tenth for the third yeare then to come, ouer and besides the two
tenths before granted, and that the tenth of this present yeare should be paid in shorter
time than it was appointed: but they flatlie denied to grant their wools, which neuerthelesse
the laitie paid, and that to their great hinderance, for it rose double to a fift&eacute;ene.
From the beginning of October, to the beginning of December this yeare, fell such abundance
of raine that it hindered greatlie the husbandmen in sowing of their winter corne:
and in the beginning of December came such a vehement frost continuing the space of
twelue w&eacute;eks, that it destroied vp all the s&eacute;ed almost that was sowne, by reason whereof
small store of winter corne came to proofe in the summer following: but though there
was no plentie, yet all kinds of graine were sold at a reasonable price, through want of
monie.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen by sea sore troubled the sea coasts of this realme, speciallie where the
champion countries stretch towards the sea coasts. At Hastings in the feast of Corpus
Christi, they burnt certeine fishermens houses, and slue some of the inhabitants. Also in
the hauens about Deuonshire and Cornewall, and towards Bristow, they tooke and burnt
certeine ships, killing the mariners that came to their hands, and in the Whitsunw&eacute;eke
they landed at Plimmouth, and burnt the more part of the towne: but Hugh Courtnie
earle of Deuonshire, a man almost fourescore yeares of age, and other knights and men
of the countrie came against these Frenchmen, sleaing such as came into their hands to
the number of fiue hundred, as was est&eacute;emed, and chased the residue. &para; The Scots
also about the same time did much hurt and great misch&eacute;efe to the Englishmen both by
sea and land.</p>

<p>In the beginning of Iulie the lord William Dowglas, with a number of men of warre,
returned from France home into England, and to him vpon his returne the castell of
Cowper was deliuered, with all the countrie thereabouts. After this, comming to the
siege of S. Iohns towne, which the gouernour the earle of Murrey, the erle of March,
Patrike de Dunbarre, and other of the Scotish lords had besieged, at length it was surrendered
by sir Thomas Vthred capiteine there of the English garison, departing in safetie
home into England. Thr&eacute;e daies before the feast of the Assumption of our ladie, there
chanced in the night season such a mightie and sudden inundation of water at Newcastell
vpon Tine, that it bare downe a p&eacute;ece of the towne wall, six perches in length, n&eacute;ere to a
place called Walknow, where a hundred and twentie temporall men with diuerse pr&eacute;ests
and manie women were drowned and lamentablie perished.</p>

<p>But now to returne to the king, which all this while remained in Brabant. Ye haue
heard how the citie of Cambrie held with the French king: wherefore the K. of England,
assembling togither a mightie strong armie aswell of Englishmen as of the low countries
of Dutchland, ment to besiege it, but first he sent the archbishop of Canturburie with the
bishops of Lincolne and Durham vnto Arras, as commissioners from him to m&eacute;et there
with the archbishop of Rouen, and the bishops of Langres and Beauuais, appointed to
come thither as commissioners from the French king, to treat with the Englishmen of a
peace, but they could not agr&eacute;e vpon anie conclusion, wherevpon king Edward, comming
forward with his power, approached to Cambrie, and planted his siege round about it.
But the bishop not meaning to deliuer the citie vnto king Edward nor vnto anie other
that should demand it to the behoofe of the emperour Ludouike of Bauiere, as then excommunicated
of the pope, had receiued into the towne fiue thousand Frenchmen, with
the French kings eldest sonne, the duke of Normandie latelie returned out of Guien, and
the lord Theobald Maruise, with certeine companies of Sauoisins, so that the citie was so
defended, that the king of England perceiuing he should but lose time, leuied his siege,
and entred into France, pitching his field at a place called Flaminguerie.</p>

England, which arriuing at Southampton the mondaie after Michaelmas day, tooke and
spoiled the towne, and the morrow after set fire vpon it in fiue places, so that a great part
of it was burnt. Also thirt&eacute;ene sailes of the French fl&eacute;et met with fiue English ships, and
after a sore fight which continued nine houres, tooke two of those fiue being tall and
goodlie ships, the one called the Edward, and the other the Christopher; the other thr&eacute;e
being smaller vessels, as two of them barks and the other a caruell escaped by their swiftnesse
of sailing. There was slaine in that fight vpon both parts about the number of six

<p>The French king himselfe hearing that the king of England would inuade his realme,
made his generall assemblie of his armie at Peronne; and when he heard that he was
entred France, he remooued towards him with his whole power, being at the point of an
hundred thousand men, as in the French chronicle y&eacute;e may read more at large. The
king of England had not past thr&eacute;escore thousand in his armie at the most: but whilest
he laie there vpon the borders of France, his people did much hurt, making roads abroad
beyond the water of Some, burning and spoiling abbies, towns, and villages, as Orignie,
saint Benoit, Ribemont in Thierasse, saint Gouan, Marle, and Cressie. Also the lord
Beaumont of Heinault burnt the towne of Guise, though his daughter was as then within
the same towne wife vnto Lewes earle of Blois: his brother William earle of Heinault
was latelie before deceassed, leauing the earledome to his sonne named also William, who
continued with the king of England so long as he laie before Cambrie, &amp; kept him within
the bounds of the empire, as though his allegiance had bound him to no lesse, but after
the said king was passed the riuer of Lescault, otherwise called the Skell, and in Latine
Scaldis, which diuideth the empire from the kingdome of France, he would no longer serue
the king of England, but departed from him for feare to offend the French king, accounting
that the matter perteined not now to the empire, but to the priuate quarell and businesse
of the king of England: notwithstanding his vncle the said sir Iohn like a faithfull
gentleman continued still in king Edward his seruice.</p>

euerie man thought that there would sure haue b&eacute;ene battell betwixt them, as there had
b&eacute;ene in d&eacute;ed, if the French king had b&eacute;ene willing; yet some saie, that he of himselfe was
disposed thereto: but his councellors aduised him to the contrarie, by reason of certeine
signs and tokens which they misliked, as the starting of an hare amongst them, and such
like. Also it was said that Robert king of Naples being then come into France, whose
knowledge in astronomie was knowne to be great, dissuaded the French king by his letters,
that in no wise he should fight with the king of England, for he had vnderstanding by art of
the heauenlie influences and disposition of the bodies aboue, that if the French king fought
with this Edward king of England, he should assuredlie be put to the worsse. Whether
this was the cause, or anie other, sure it is that the Frenchmen had no mind to fight, so
that these two mightie armies departed in sunder without battell, and the king of England
returned into Flanders, sorie in d&eacute;ed that he had not with him halfe the number that the
French king had, yet in trust of the valiancie of his souldiers, chosen out of the pikedst
men through England and all the low countrie on this side the Rhene, he ment verelie to

<p>At his comming backe into Brabant, there was a councell called at Brussels, where were
present all those lords of the empire which had b&eacute;ene with him in that iournie, as the
dukes of Brabant, Gelderland, and Gulike, the marques of Blankbourgh, the earle of Bergen,
the lord Beaumont of Heinault otherwise called sir Iohn de Heinault, the lord of
Valkenbourgh, and manie others. Thither came also Iaques Arteueld ch&eacute;efe gouernour
of Flanders. Here in councell taken how the king of England might best mainteine the
wars which he had begun thus against the French king, he was aduised that he should in
anie wise require them of Flanders to aid him and in his quarell to defie the French king,
and to go with him against the said French king, and if they would thus doo, then should
he promise them to recouer and deliuer into their hands the towns of Lisle, Dowaie, and
Bethon. The king of England, according to this aduise to him giuen, made such request
to the Flemings, who therevpon desired time to consult togither, what they might doo
therein, and finallie they declared for answer, that they would gladlie so doo, but yet
whereas they were bound by faith and oth, and in the summe of two millians of florens in
the popes chamber, not to make nor mooue any warre against the king of France, whosoeuer
he were, on paine to lose that summe, and beside to run in the sentence of cursing,
they besought him, that it might stand with his pleasure, to take vpon him the title and
armes of France, as the same apperteined to him of right, and then would they obey him
as rightfull K. of France, and require of him acquittances in discharge of their bonds, and
he to pardon them thereof, as rightfull king of France.</p>

<p>The king of England, though he had iust cause to claime the crowne of France, in right
of his mother qu&eacute;ene Isabell, yet to take vpon him the name and armes of that realme,
before he had made conquest of any part thereof, he thought it stood not with much
reason: but yet after he had caused the matter to be throughlie debated amongst them
of his councell, as well to satisfie the Flemings, as for other respects, he saw it should be
the best waie that might be taken to the aduancement of his purpose. Then he answered
the Flemings, that if they would sweare, and seale to this accord, and promise to mainteine
his warre, he would be contented to fulfill their desire, and also he promised to get
for them againe the townes of Lisle, Dowaie, and Bethune. Herevpon was a day assigned
to m&eacute;et at Gant: the king came thither, and the most part of the said lords, and
all the councellors of the good townes &amp; places in Flanders were there assembled, and so
all the foresaid matters were rehearsed, sworne, and sealed, and the armes of France were
then quartered with those of England, and from thenceforth he tooke vpon him the name
of king of France, in all his writings, proclamations, and commandements. This is noted
by Christopher Okland, where speaking of the mingling of the French and English armes,

<div class="sidenote">Lewes Hutine.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Philip le Long.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Charles le Beau.</div>

<p>&para; Sith then that we be come to this place, it shall not be much amisse to rehearse
somewhat of the right and title whereby king Edward did thus claime the crowne of
France, hauing of purpose omitted to speak thereof, till now that he intituled himselfe
with the name, &amp; tooke vpon him to beare the armes also of France, vpon occasion
before expressed. It is well knowne that Philip le Beau king of France had issue by his
wife qu&eacute;ene Ione thr&eacute;e sons, Lewis surnamed Hutine, Philip le Long, and Charles le
Beau; also two daughters, the one dieng in hir infancie, and the other named Isabell liued,
and was maried vnto Edward the second of that name king of England, who begot of hir
this Edward the third, that made this claime. The thr&eacute;e sonnes of the foresaid Philip le
Beau reigned ech after other, as kings of France. First after Philip the father, succ&eacute;eded
his eldest sonne Lewes Hutine, who had issue by his first wife Margaret, daughter to Robert
duke of Burgogne, a daughter named Ione, the which was anon giuen in mariage
vnto Lewes earle of Eureux: but she liuing not long, died without issue. Hir father the
said Lewes Hutine married after the deceasse of his first wife, an other wife named Clemence,
daughter to Charles Martell, the father of K. Robert of Sicill, whom he left great
with child when he died. The child being borne proued a son, &amp; was named Iohn, but
liued not manie daies after. Then Philip the Long was admitted vnto the crowne of
France, though manie stood in opinion that Ione the daughter of Lewes Hutine, which
yet was aliue, ought to haue inherited the kingdome after hir father: and namelie Odo
duke of Burgogne, vncle to the said Ione, was most earnest in that matter, in fauour of
his n&eacute;ece. But might ouercame right, so that he was constreined to be quiet. Philip le
Long, after he had reigned fiue yeares, died also, and left no issue behind him. Then
lastlie Charles le Beau tooke vpon him the kingdome, and the seuenth yeare after died,
his wife big bellied, which shortlie after brought foorth a maiden named Blanch, that
streightwaies hasting to follow hir father, liued no while in this world. By this means
then the bloud roiall in the heires male of Philip le Beau was extinguished in his sonne the
foresaid Charles le Beau, whereof the contention tooke beginning about the right to the
crowne of France, betwixt the Frenchmen and Englishmen, which hangeth as yet vndecided
till these our daies. For king Edward auerred that the kingdome of France apperteined
vnto him as lawfull heire, bicause that he alone was remaining of the kings stocke,
and touched his mothers father Philip le Beau, in the next degr&eacute;e of consanguinitie, as he
that was borne of his daughter Isabell.</p>

<p>Therefore immediatlie after the deceasse of the said Charles le Beau, by ambassadours
sent vnto the p&eacute;eres of France, he published to them his right, requiring that they would
admit him king according therevnto: but his ambassadours could neuer be quietlie heard,
and therefore returned home without anie towardlie answer, which mooued him in the
end to attempt the recouerie of his lawfull inheritance by force, sith by law he could not
preuaile, and now by aduise of his fr&eacute;ends to take vpon him both the title and armes of
France, to signifie to the world what right he had to the same. After that this league
therefore was concluded with them of Flanders, and that king Edward had taken vpon
him the name of king of France with the armes; the duke of Gelderland and Iaques van
Arteueld went vnto all the good townes and iurisdictions of Flanders, to receiue their
oths of fidelitie vnto king Edward, persuading with the people, that the supreme rule belonged
vnto him, sauing to the townes their ancient lawes and liberties, and to their earle
his right of proprietie.</p>

<p>About the latter end of this thirt&eacute;enth yeare of K. Edwards reigne, the mariners and
sea-men of the cinque ports, getting them aboord into a number of small ships and balingers,
well trimmed and appointed for the purpose, passed ouer to Bullongne, where they
tooke land one day in a thicke foggie weather, and setting on the Base towne, they burnt
ninet&eacute;ene gallies, foure great ships, and to the number of twentie smaller vessels, togither
with their tackle and furniture. They set fire also on the houses that stood n&eacute;ere to the
water side, and namelie they burnt one great house, wherein laie such a number of oares,
sailes, armour, and crossebowes, as might haue sufficed to furnish so manie men as could
be well aboord in ninet&eacute;ene gallies. There were manie slaine on both parts in atchiuing
this enterprise, but more of the Frenchmen than of the Englishmen. About the same
time the qu&eacute;ene of England was deliuered of hir fourth sonne in the towne of Gaunt, the
which was named Iohn, first created earle of Richmond, and after duke of Lancaster. He
was borne about Christmasse, in the thirt&eacute;enth yere of king Edwards reigne.</p>

<p>When king Edward had finished his businesse with the Flemings at Gaunt, he left his
wife qu&eacute;ene Philip there still in that towne, and returned himselfe vnto Antwerpe, and
shortlie after about the feast of Candlemasse tooke the sea, and came backe into England,
to prouide for monie to mainteine his begun warres. And herevpon about the time of
Lent following, he called his high court of parlement at Westminster, in the which he asked
of his commons towards his charges, for the recouerie of his right in France, the fift
part of their mooueable goods, the customes of wools for two yeares to be paid aforehand,
and the ninth sheafe of euerie mans corne. At length it was agr&eacute;ed, that the king should
haue for euerie sacke of wooll fortie shillings, for euerie thr&eacute;e hundred wooll fels fortie
shillings, and for euerie last of leather fortie shillings, and for other merchandize after the
rate; to begin at the feast of Easter, in this fouret&eacute;enth yeare of the kings reigne, and to
indure till the feast of Pentecost, then next following, and from that feast till the feast of
Pentecost then next insuing into one yeare: for which the king granted, that from the feast
of Pentecost, which was then to come into one yeare, he nor his heires should not demand
assesse, nor take, nor suffer to be assessed or taken, more custome of a sacke of wooll of
any Englishman, but halfe a marke, and vpon the wooll fels and leather the old former
custome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The citie of London lendeth the king monie.</div>

<p>Beside this, the citizens and burgesses of cities and good townes, granted to giue the ninth

br&eacute;eding cattell, nor of sh&eacute;epe, should giue the fift&eacute;enth part of all their goods lawfullie

might without let safelie come into the realme of England with their goods and merchandize,
and safelie tarie, and likewise returne, paieng the customs, subsidies, and profits,

And for the leuieng thereof, the lords of euerie shire through the land, were appointed
to answer him, euerie one for the circuit within the which he dwelled. And
bicause the king must n&eacute;eds occupie much monie yer the receit of this subsidie could
come to his hands, he borowed in the meane time manie notable summes of diuerse cities,

<p>In the meane while, now that king Edward was come backe into England, the warres
were hotlie pursued against his fr&eacute;ends, that had their lands n&eacute;ere to the borders of
France, and namelie against sir Iohn de Heinault lord Beaumont, for the Frenchmen
burned all his lands of Chimaie, except the fortresses, and tooke from thence a great
preie. All the frontiers were full of men of warre, lodged within townes in garrison, as
at Tournie, Mortaigne, S. Amond, Dowaie, Cambrie, and in other smaller fortresses.
These men of warre laie not idle, but were dooing oftentimes in Flanders, and sometime
otherwhere, neither was the countrie of Heinault spared, though the earle (as y&eacute;e haue
heard) did not onelie refuse to serue the king of England against France, but also when
the same king entred France, he resorted to the French king, and serued him; yet by the
suggestion of the bishop of Cambrie, who complained of the Hainuiers, for the damages
which they had doone him, the French garrisons of the frontiers thereabouts were commanded
to make a road into that countrie, which they did, burning the towne of Asper,
and brought from thence a great bootie. The earle of Heinault sore mooued therewith
to haue his lands so spoiled and burnt, defied the French king, and ioining with his vncle
the lord Beaumont, entred with an armie into Thierasse, tooke &amp; destroied Aubenton,

to saie any diuine seruice: wherevpon the Flemings sent ouer into England certeine messengers
to giue notice to king Edward how they were intreated, but he sent them word
that he would bring at his comming ouer vnto them, priests that should saie masses and
other seruice, whether the pope would or not, for he had priuilege so to doo. &para; In
Aprill, William Melton archbishop of Yorke departed this life, after whome variance rose
in the election of a new gouernour to that church, so that two were elected, William la
Zouch and William Killesbie: but at length William la Zouch tooke place, being the 43
archbishop that had sit in that seat. &para; The earles of Salisburie and Suffolke, which were
left in Flanders by king Edward to helpe the Flemings, shortlie after Ester, or (as other
haue) in the time of Lent, were discomfited by the garrison of Lisle, and taken prisoners
as they would haue passed by that towne, to haue ioined with Iaques Arteueld, meaning
to besiege Tournie; but now by the taking of those two earles that enterprise was broken.
The duke of Normandie with a great armie entred into Heinault, burning and

<p>The French king being aduertised, that the king of England meant shortlie to returne
into Flanders with a great power, in purpose to inuade the realme of France on that
side, assembled a nauie of foure hundred ships vnder the leading of thr&eacute;e expert capteins
of the warres by sea, as sir Hugh Kiriell, sir Peter Bahuchet, and a Geneweis named
Barbe Noir, appointing them to the coasts of Flanders to defend the king of England from
landing there, if by any meanes they might. These thr&eacute;e capteins or admerals came and
laie with their ships in the hauen of Sluise, for that it was supposed the king of England
would arriue there, as his meaning was ind&eacute;ed, wherevpon when his men, ships, and prouisions
were once readie in the moneth of Iune, he tooke the sea with two hundred saile,
and directing his course towards Flanders, there came vnto him the lord Robert Morley,
with the north nauie of England, so that then he had in all about thr&eacute;e hundred saile, or
(as other saie) two hundred and thr&eacute;e score.</p>

<p>The French nauie laie betwixt Sluise and Blancbergh, so that when the king of England
approched, either part descried other, &amp; therewith prepared them to battell. The
king of England staied, till the sunne which at the first was in his face, came somewhat
westward, and so had it vpon his backe, that it should not hinder the sight of his people,
and so therewith did set vpon his enimies with great manhood, who likewise verie stoutlie
incountered him, by reason whereof insued a sore and deadlie fight betwixt them. The
nauies on both sides were diuided into thr&eacute;e battels. On the English part, the earles of
Glocester, Northampton and Huntington, who was admerall of the fl&eacute;et that belonged to
the cinque ports, and the lord Robert Morley admerall of the northerne nauie had the
guiding of the fore ward, bearing themselues right valiantlie, so that at length the Englishmen
hauing the aduantage, not onlie of the sunne, but also of the wind and tide, so fortunatlie,
that the French fl&eacute;et was driuen into the streights of the hauen, in such wise that
neither the souldiers nor mariners could helpe themselues, in somuch that both heauen,
sea, and wind, s&eacute;emed all to haue conspired against the Frenchmen. And herewith
manie ships of Flanders ioining themselues with the English fl&eacute;et, in the end the Frenchmen
were vanquished, slaine and taken, their ships being also either taken, bowged, or
broken.</p>

<p>When night was come vpon them, there were thirtie French ships, that yet had not
entred the battell, the which sought by couert of the night to haue stolne awaie, and one
of them being a mightie great vessell, called the Iames of D&eacute;epe, would haue taken awaie
with hir a ship of Sandwich that belonged to the prior of Canturburie: but by the helpe
of the earle of Huntington, after they had fought all the night till the next morning, the
Englishmen at length preuailed, and taking that great huge ship of D&eacute;epe, found in hir
aboue foure hundred dead bodies. To conclude, verie few of the French ships escaped,
except some of their smaller vessels, and certeine gallies with their admerall Barbenoir,
who in the beginning of the battell got foorth of the hauen, aduising the other capteins to
doo the like, thereby to auoid the danger which they wilfullie imbraced. There died in
this battell fought (as some write) on midsummer daie, in the yeare aforesaid, of Frenchmen
to the number of 30000, of Englishmen about 4000, or (as other haue that liued in
those daies) not past 400, amongst whom there were foure knights of great nobilitie,
as sir Thomas Monhermere, sir Thomas Latimer, sir Iohn Boteler, and sir Thomas
Poinings.</p>

this time, amongst other of the French ships that were taken there. &para; Sir Peter Bahuchet
was hanged vpon a crosse pole fastened to a mast of one of the ships. Through
the wilfulnesse of this man, the Frenchmen receiued this losse (as the French chronicles
report) bicause he kept the nauie so long within the hauen, till they were so inclosed by
the Englishmen that a great number of the Frenchmen could neuer come to strike stroke,
nor to vse the shot of their artillerie, but to the hurt of their fellows. Howsoeuer it was,
the Englishmen got a famous victorie, to the great comfort of themselues, and discomfort
of their aduersaries. &para; The king of England, after he had thus vanquished his enimies,
remained on the sea by the space of thr&eacute;e daies, and then comming on land, went to Gant,
where he was receiued of the qu&eacute;ene with great ioy and gladnesse.</p>

<p>In this meane while had the duke of Normandie besieged the castell of Thuine Leuesques,
n&eacute;ere to Cambrie, which was taken by sir Walter of Mannie, a lord of Heinault,
at the first beginning of the warres, and euer since till that time kept to the king of England
his vse. The earle of Heinault, who had b&eacute;ene of late both in England with king
Edward, and also in Almaine with the emperour, to purchase their assistance for the
defense of his countrie against the inuasions of the Frenchmen, was now returned home,
and meaning to rescue such as were besieged in Thuine, sent for succours into Flanders,
and into Almaine, and in the meane time leuieng such power as he could make with his
owne countrie, came therewith to Valenciennes, whither foorthwith resorted vnto him the
earle of Namure with two hundred speares, the duke of Brabant with six hundred, the
duke of Gelderland, the earle of Bergen, the lord of Valkenburgh, and diuerse other, the
which togither with the earle of Heinault went and lodged alongst by the riuer of

<p>There came also to the aid of the earle of Heinault Iaques Arteueld, with his thr&eacute;e

departed in sunder, but they did not. For after it was knowne how the king of England
was arriued in Flanders, and had discomfited the French fl&eacute;et, the duke of Brabant and
others thought good to breake vp their enterprise for that time, and to resort vnto the
king of England, to vnderstand what his purpose was to doo. Neither were the Frenchmen
hastie to giue battell, so that after the capteins of Thuine Leuesques, sir Richard
Limosin knight an Englishman, and two esquiers, brethren to the erle of Namure, Iohn
and Thierrie, had left their fortresse void, and were come ouer the riuer by boats vnto
the earle of Heinaults campe, the armies on both sides brake vp and departed, the
Frenchmen into France, and the other to Valenciennes, and from thence the princes
and great lords drew to Gaunt, to welcome the king of England into the countrie, of
whome they were right ioifullie receiued: and after they had communed togither of their
affaires, it was appointed by the king, that they should m&eacute;et him at Villefort in Brabant
at a daie prefixed, where he would be readie to consult with them about his proc&eacute;edings

<p>The French king being informed that the king of England ment to laie siege vnto
Tournie, as it was ind&eacute;ed deuised at this councell holden at Villefort, tooke order for the
furnishing thereof with men, munition, and vittels in most defensible wise. There were
sent to that towne the best men of warre in all France, as the earle of Ewe constable of
France, the yoong earle of Guines his sonne, the earle of Foiz and his brethren, the earle
Amerie de Narbon, with manie other, hauing with them foure thousand souldiers. Sir
Godmar du Foie was there before as capteine of the towne, so that it was prouided of all
things necessarie. Howbeit, the king of England (according as it was appointed at the
councell holden at Villefort, about the feast of Marie Magdalen) departed from Gaunt,
and came to Tournie, hauing with him seauen earles of his owne countrie, as Darbie,
Penbroke, Hereford, Huntingdon, Northampton, Glocester, and Arundell, eight prelats,
eight and twentie baronets, two hundred knights, foure thousand men of armes, and nine
thousand archers, besides other footmen. He lodged at the gate called saint Martine,

Heinault: also Iaques Arteueld, who brought with him about fortie thousand Flemings.
So that there was at this siege to the number of six score thousand men, as some writers
affirme. There was also an other armie of Flemings, as of the townes of Ypres, Popringue,
Furnes, Cassell, of the Chateleinie, &amp; of Bergis, being to the number of fortie
thousand, appointed to make warre against the Frenchmen that kept saint Omers, and
other townes there on the frontiers of Arthois, which armie was led by the earle of Richmond,
otherwise called the lord Robert Dartois, and by sir Henrie de Flanders, the
which approching one day to saint Omers, were sharplie fought with; for within saint
Omers at that time laie a strong power of Frenchmen with the duke of Burgoine, the

<p>The Flemings were not willing to serue, for neither had they any trust in their capteine
the said erle of Richmond, neither would they willinglie haue passed out of their owne
confines, but onlie to defend the same from the inuasion of their enimies: yet through
much persuasion, forward they went, diuided into sundrie battels contrarie to their manner.
The enimies perceiuing some aduantage, issued forth vpon them, and assailed them
verie stoutlie, insomuch that the earle of Arminacke setting vpon them of Ypres, ouerthrew
them, and chased them vnto a towne called Arques, which they had a little before
set on fire and burned. An other companie of Frenchmen, skirmishing with them of
Franks, Furnes, and Bergis, put them also to the worse. Contrarilie, those Frenchmen
that encountered with the lord Robert Dartois, and them of Bruges whome he led,
susteined great losse, and were beaten backe into the citie: the duke of Burgoine himselfe
being in no small danger for a time, so sharpe the bickering was betwixt them, and
the euent so variable. Wherefore it is notablie and fitlie said in this behalfe, that</p>

<p>There be that write, that this fight continued from thr&eacute;e of the clocke till euentide, and
that the earle of Richmond was twise put to flight, for his people did leaue him in the
plaine field: but at length by the aduise of sir Thomas Vthred, whome the king of England
had appointed to attend the said earle, with manie Englishmen and archers, he
assembled his people eftsoones togither againe, and setting on his enimies. Now when
it was almost night, n&eacute;ere to the gates of saint Omers, he finallie ouercame them, where
were slaine of the French part fift&eacute;ene barons and fourescore knights, beside a great
number of other people. Diuerse also were slaine on the earle of Richmonds part at
this last encounter, and among other an English knight, that bare armes eschecked siluer
and gules.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Richmond in danger to be slaine.</div>

<p>Finallie, as the earle of Richmond returned towards his campe, which laie in the vale
of Cassell, he met with certeine Artesines and Frenchmen, which had b&eacute;ene chasing the
other Flemings, and though it was late in the euening, that one could not take good view
of an other, yet here they fought againe, and so diuerse of the Frenchmen were taken
and killed, and amongst other that were caught, was a knight of Burgoine, named sir
William de Nillie. But when the earle of Richmond and those that were with him came
to the place where the campe laie, they found that all the residue of the Flemings were
fled and gone. And when the said earle came to Cassell, the people were readie to haue
slaine him, their former malice towards him being now much increased with the euill
successe of this passed enterprise, so that he was glad to get him thence, and to repaire
vnto king Edward, that laie yet at the siege before Tournie, during which siege manie
proper feats of armes were doone betwixt those within and them without: for few daies
passed without the atchiuing of some enterprise.</p>

<p>Also the French king, hauing made his assemblie at Arras, and got thither a mightie

Bouuins, thr&eacute;e leagues from Tournie. There were with him the king of Bohem, the
duke of Lorreine, the bishop of Mentz, the earles of Bar, mount Belliard, &amp; Sauoie, also
the dukes of Burgogne and Burbone, with a great number of other earles and lords, so
that the greatest puissance of all France was iudged to be there with the king. Whilest
he laie incamped thus at Bouuins, and the king of England at Tournie, manie exploits
were atchiued betwixt their people, who laie not idle, but still rode abroad and oftentimes
met, and then that part which was weakest paied for the others charges, so that
manie were slaine &amp; taken on both sides as well of the nobilitie as other. Also diuerse
townes were sacked and burned on the frontiers of France, during this siege at Tournie,

bonds indangered to paie by forfeiture, or otherwise, for any matter before that time vnto
the crowne of France. Also they were released of the interdiction and cursse of the
church, and then also was their earle restored home. It was further accorded, that the
French king should restore vnto the king of England certeine townes and places in Guien,
which in the beginning of these warres the earle of Alanson had taken from the Englishmen,
as Penne in Agenois, and others. Also whereas the French king had seized the

to passe, none would be had, which turned not onelie to the hinderance of the kings
whole proc&eacute;edings, but also to his great discredit, and causing him to run greatlie in
debt by interest, through borrowing of monie, for the paiment of the wages of his men of
warre, when through the archbishops negligence, who had the ch&eacute;efe rule of the land, the
collectors and other officers slacked their duetie, whereby there was no monie sent ouer,
according to that was appointed: and wheras now, since his comming ouer, he had sent
to the archbishop to come vnto him, that by his information, he might the better learne
who they were that neglected their duetie, he disobedientlie refused to come, pretending
some feare of bodilie harme, through the malice of some that were about the king. Wherevpon,
when Rafe lord Stafford, lord steward of the kings house, was sent with a safe
conduct, for him to come in all safetie to the court, he flatlie made answer that he would
not come, except in full parlement.</p>

<p>Manie other misdemeanors was the archbishop charged with towards the king in that
letter, as maliciouslie slandering the king for vniust oppression of the people, confounding
the cleargie, and gr&eacute;euing the church with exactions, leuies of monie, tolles and tallages.
Therefore, sith he went about to slander the kings roiall authoritie, to defame his
seruants, to stirre rebellion among the people; and to withdraw the deuotion and loue
of the earles, lords, and great men of the land from the king: his highnesse declared,
that he meant to prouide for the integritie &amp; preseruation of his good name (whereof it
is said trulie,</p>

<p>and to m&eacute;et with the archbishops malice. And herewith diuerse things were rehersed to
the archbishops reproch, which he should doo, procure, and suffer to be doone, by his
euill and sinister counsell, whilest he had the rule of the realme in his hands vnder the
king: wherein he had shewed himselfe not onelie an acceptor of gifts, but also of persons,
in gratifieng diuerse that nothing had deserued sundrie waies foorth, and presuming to doo
rashlie manie other things to the detriment of the kings roiall state, and hurt of his regall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</a></span>
dignitie, and to no small damage of the people, abusing the authoritie and office to him
committed, so that if he persisted in his obstinate wilfulnesse, and rebellious contumacie,
the king by those his letters signified, that he meant to declare it more apparantlie in due
time and place, and therefore commanded the said deane and chapiter of Paules, to publish
all those things openlie, in places where they thought conuenient, according to their
wisedome giuen to them by God, so as he might haue cause to commend therein their
carefull diligence. &para; This letter was dated at Westminster the tenth of Februarie, in the
fift&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne ouer England, and second ouer France.</p>

<p>Where the Londoners would not permit the kings iustices to sit within the citie of London,
contrarie to their liberties, the king appointed them to sit in the tower; and when
they would not make anie answer there, a great tumult was raised by the commons of the
citie, so that the iustices being in some perill (as they thought) feigned themselues to sit
there till towards Easter. Wherevpon, when the king could not get the names of them
that raised the tumult, no otherwise but that they were certeine light persons of the common
people, he at length pardoned the offense. After this, those iustices neither sat in
the tower, nor elsewhere, of all that yeare.</p>

<p>In the quindene of Easter, the king held a parlement at London, in the which, the prelats,
earls, barons, and commons, presented manie petitions; as to haue the great charter
of liberties, and the charter of forrests dulie obserued, and that they which brake the same
should be discharged of their offices, if they were the kings officers, and that the high
officers of the king should be elected and chosen by their p&eacute;eres in parlement. The king
withstood these petitions a certeine time, yet at length he granted to some of them; but
as concerning the election of his officers, he in no wise would consent, but yet he was
contented that they should receiue an oth in parlement, to doo iustice to all men in their
offices, &amp;c. Vpon which article and others, a statute was made and confirmed with the

<p>In the meane while, the French king had with bribes wonne Lewes of Bauaria, that
named himselfe emperour, from further fauouring the king of England; in so much that,
vnder a colourable pretense of finding himselfe gr&eacute;eued, for that the king of England had
without his knowledge taken truce with the French king, he reuoked the dignitie of being
vicar in the empire, from the king of England, but yet signified to him, that where the
French king had at his request put the matter in controuersie betwixt him and the king of
England into his hands, to make an end thereof, if it so pleased the king of England, that
he should treat as an indifferent arbitrator betwixt them, he promised to doo his indeuour,
so as he doubted not, but that by his means he should come to a good agr&eacute;ement in his
cause, if he would follow his aduise. And to receiue answer hereof, he sent his letters
by one Eberhard a chapleine of his, the reader of the friers heremits to S. Augustins order,
requesting the king of England to aduertise him by the same messenger, of his whole mind

which he had to make an accord betwixt him and his aduersarie Philip de Valois, that
named himselfe French king, he could not but much commend him, and for his part he
had euer wished, that some reasonable agr&eacute;ement might be had betwixt them: but sith his
right to the realme of France was cl&eacute;ere and manifest inough, he purposed not to commit
it by writing vnto the doubtfull iudgement or arbitrement of anie. And as concerning the
agr&eacute;ement which the emperour had made with the French king, bicause (as he alledged)
it was lawfull for him so to doo, sith without the emperors knowledge he had taken truce
with the same French king, he said, if the circumstances were well considered, that matter
could not minister any cause to mooue him to such agr&eacute;ement: for if the emperour remembred,
he had giuen to him libertie at all times to treat of peace, without making the
emperour priuie thereto (so that without his assent, he concluded not vpon any finall
peace) which he protested that he neuer meant to doo, till he might haue his prouident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</a></span>

of the empire from him, he tooke it doone out of time; for it was promised, that no such
reuocation should be made, till he had obteined the whole realme of France, or at the

<p>This yeare, about Midsummer, or somwhat before, at Gant in Flanders, died the lord
Geffrey Scrope the kings iustice, and Henrie bishop of Lincolne, two ch&eacute;efe councellors
to the king. The qu&eacute;ene after hir returne into England, was this yeare brought to bed
in the tower of London of a daughter named Blanch, that died yoong, and was buried at
Westminster. &para; In this meane while, during the warres betwixt France and England, the
French king in fauour of Dauid king of Scotland, had sent men of warre into Scotland,
vnder the conduct of sir Arnold Dandreghen, who was after one of the marshals of France,
and the lord of Garrentiers, with other, by whose comfort and helpe, the Scots that
tooke part with king Dauid, did indeuor themselues to recouer out of the Englishmens
hands, such castels and fortresses as they held within Scotland, as in the Scotish historie
ye shall find mentioned, and how about this time, their king the foresaid Dauid returned
foorth of France into Scotland by the French kings helpe, who hauing long before concluded
a league with him, thought by his friendship to trouble the king of England so at

that shuld there treat of the peace, when the day assigned of their m&eacute;eting was

king, there came the earle of Alanson, the duke of Burbon, the earle of Flanders, the
earle of Blois, the archbishop of Sens, the bishop of Beauuois, and the bishop of Auxerre.
The pope sent thither two cardinals, Naples and Cleremont; these commissioners were in
treatie fift&eacute;ene daies, during the which, manie matters were put forth and argued, but
none concluded; for the Englishmen demanded largelie, and the Frenchmen would depart
with nothing, sauing with the countie of Pontieu, the which was giuen with qu&eacute;ene
Isabell in marriage to the king of England. So the treatie brake, the commissioners
departed, and nothing doone, but onelie that the truce was prolonged for two yeares
further.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The occasion of the wars of Britaine.</div>

<p>Thus were the wars partlie appeased in some part of France, but yet was the truce but
slenderlie kept in other parts, by reason of the duke of Britaine. For whereas contention
arose betwixt one Charles de Blois, and Iohn earle of Mountfort, about the right to the
duchie of Britaine, as in the historie of France maie more plainelie appeare; the earle of
Mountfort, thinking that he had wrong offered him at the French kings hands, who fauoured
his aduersarie Charles de Blois, alied himselfe with the king of England. And
(as some write) after he had woone diuerse cities and townes within Britaine, he came
ouer into England, and by doing homage to king Edward, acknowledged to hold it of
him, as of the souereigne lord thereof, so that he would promise to defend him and that
duchie against his aduersaries: which the king promised him to doo. After this, the
French king made such warres against this earle of Mountfort, that he was at length taken
prisoner in the towne of Naunts, and committed to safe k&eacute;eping within the castell of Loure
at Paris. But his wife being a stout woman, and of a manlie courage, stood vp in the
quarrell of hir husband, and presented a yoong sonne which she had by him, vnto such
capteins and men of warre as serued hir husband, requiring them not to be dismaid with
the infortunate chance of hir husbands taking; but rather like men of good stomachs, to
stand in defense of his right, sith whatsoeuer happened to him, the same remained in

<p>This countesse of Mountfort was sister vnto Lewes earle of Flanders, and named Margaret,
and not Claudia (as some write.) She was verie diligent in hir businesse, and
spared no trauell to aduance hir cause, so that she wan not onelie the harts of the men
of warre, but also of the people of Britaine, the which fauoured hir husband, and lamented
the mishap of his taking. She first furnished such cities, townes, castels, and
fortresses as hir husband had in possession, with men, munition and vittels, as Renes,
Dinaunt, Guerand, Hanibout, and others. This doone, she sent ouer into England, sir
Emerie de Clisson, a noble man of Britaine, to require the king of England of succors,
with condition, that if it pleased him, hir sonne Iohn should marrie one of his daughters.
&para;The king of England glad to haue such an entrie into France, as by Britaine,
thought not to refuse the offer, &amp; therevpon granted to aid the countesse: &amp; foorthwith
raising a power, sent the same ouer into Britaine, vnder the conduct of the lord Walter
of Mannie, and others: the which at length, after they had continued long vpon the
sea, by reason of contrarie winds, arriued in Britaine; in which meane time, a great
armie of Frenchmen were entred into Britaine, and had besieged the citie of Renes, and
finallie woone it by surrender, &amp; were now before the towne of Hanibout, which with
streict siege, and sore brusing of the walles, they were n&eacute;ere at point to haue taken, and
the countesse of Mountfort within it; if the succours of England had not arriued there,
euen at such time as the Frenchmen were in talke with them within, about the surrender.
But after that the English fl&eacute;et was s&eacute;ene to approch, the treatie was soone broken

greatlie recomforted the said countesse, as she well shewed by hir ch&eacute;erefull countenance
in receiuing them. Shortlie after their arriuall, a certeine number of the English archers,
issuing foorth, beat the Frenchmen from an engine which they had reared against the
walles, and set fire vpon the same engine. To conclude, the Frenchmen liked the Englishmen
so well, that shortlie after being wearie of their companie, they raised their siege
to get themselues further from them: and in an other part of the countrie indeuoured
themselues to win townes and castels as they did ind&eacute;ed, hauing their armie diuided into
two parts, the lord Charles de Blois gouerning the one part, and a Spaniard called the
lord Lewes de Spaine the other (which was the same that thus departed from the siege of
Hanibout, after the arriuall of the Englishmen) and then winning the townes of Dinand
and Guerand, passed into the countrie of Britaine Britonant, and there not farre from
Quinpercorentine, were discomfited by the Englishmen, who followed them thither.
Of six thousand Genowaies, Spaniards, and Frenchmen, which the lord Lewes of Spaine
had there with him, there escaped but a few awaie. A nephue which he had there
with him named Alfonse was slaine, howbeit he himselfe escaped, though not without sore

hir, tooke the sea at Southampton, and at length met with the lord Lewes of Spaine, and
his fl&eacute;et, where betwixt them was fought a sore battell. Of the Englishmen there were six
and fortie vessels, but the lord Lewes of Spaine had nine great ships, and of more force
than anie of those which the Englishmen had, and also he had thr&eacute;e gallies. They began
to fight about euensong time, and continued till that night parted them, and had gone togither
againe in the morning, if by a tempest, that rose about midnight, the same night, they
had not b&eacute;ene scattered in sunder. The Spaniards and Genowaies tooke awaie with them
foure English ships, which being vittellers, were left behind. And bicause the same
Spaniards and Genowaies were able to abide the sea better than the Englishmen, by reason
of their great ships, they kept the maine sea; but the Englishmen were aduised by their
mariners to drawe vnto the land, and so they did, arriuing at a little hauen, not farre from
Vannes, where comming on land, they streightwaie made towards that citie, and besieged it,
not ceassing to assault it both day and night, till at length they wan it, by giuing the
assault in two places at once, whilest an other number of them set vpon it in a third place,
where was no suspicion, and so entred.</p>

<p>After this, the most part of the Englishmen departed from Vannes, as some with the
countesse, to bring hir vnto Hanibout, and some with the earls of Salisburie, Suffolke, and
Cornewall, who went and laid siege to Rennes, so that the earle of Richmond remained in
Vannes, with the lords Spenser and Stafford, to k&eacute;epe it, hauing a certeine number of
archers and other men of warre with them. The lord Clisson, and sir Henrie de Leon,
which were within Vannes, when it was taken by the Englishmen, and found means to
escape, were abashed at the matter, that they had so lost the citie, wherevpon they secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</a></span>lie
assembled a great power of men thereabouts, and came againe vnto Vannes, and so
fiercelie assailed the gates and wals, that in the end they entred by more force. The earle
of Richmond was sore hurt, but yet he escaped out at a posterne gate, and the lord Stafford
with him, but the lord Spenser was taken by sir Henrie de Leon.</p>

<p>Other write otherwise, both of the landing, and also concerning the misfortune of the
lord Spenser, alledging letters sent from the earle of Northampton (whome the same
authors repute as generall of that armie into Britaine) directed to the king, in which was
signified, how that within the octaues of the Assumption of our ladie, they ariued on the
coast of Britaine, n&eacute;ere to the towne and castell of Brest, in the which the dutchesse of
Britaine with hir children were of the enimies besieged, both by sea and land, by sea with
thirt&eacute;ene great gallies, by land by the lord Charles de Blois, the earls of Sauoie and Foiz.
But the gallies perceiuing the English fl&eacute;et to be approched vpon them, yer they were
aware, so that they were compassed in, to their great danger, thr&eacute;e of the same gallies fled,
and so escaped, the residue got vp into a riuer of the same hauen, where they that were
aboord, left their vessels and fled to the land, and as well they, as the other that held siege
before Brest and such as kept a castell there, not farre off, called Goule forrest, packed
awaie without anie more adoo. The English mariners following the gallies (that were
withdrawn vp the riuer) with their small boats and barges, set fire on the gallies, and so
burnt them.</p>

<p>Thus all the Englishmen came on land, and leauing the lord Saie capteine in the said
castell of Goule forrest, they passed forward into the countrie, and comming to a castell
commonlie called Monsieur Relix, gaue an assault thereto, where manie of their men of
warre were wounded, and sir Iames Louell slaine. After this, staieng a time for the
comming of their confederats, which after a fortnights space came to them on the mondaie,
being the morrow after Michaelmas daie, they heard that the lords Charles de Blois was
comming in all hast with a power of thr&eacute;e thousand men of armes, twelue hundred
Genowaies, &amp; a great multitude of commons to raise the siege. Whervpon the earle of
Northampton with his armie marched softlie towards them, and choosing a plot of ground
conuenient for his purpose, fought with his enimies, slue and tooke of them at the least
thr&eacute;e hundred men of armes. The earle of Northampton lost not any noble man in this

of being tossed on the seas, his wounds rankled so, that shortlie after his comming to London
he died, &amp; was buried in the church of S. Paule. The king of England was sore

he left the earle of Arundell, and the lord Stafford to continue the siege, whilest he went
to Rennes to aid his people, which still laie at the siege thereof. Before the kings arriuall
in Britaine, those that were there vnder the earle of Northampton, as the lord Hugh
Spenser, and the lord Richard Talbot, with their retinues, fought with the Frenchmen

informed, how the duke of Normandie was comming downe towards him, with an armie of
fortie thousand men. Herevpon he sent for them that laie at siege before Naunts to come
vnto him, and suffered them at Rennes to k&eacute;epe their siege still, till they heard other word
from him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Normandie commeth downe into Britaine.</div>

<p>The duke of Normandie with foure thousand men of armes, and thirtie thousand other
men of warre, comming into Britaine to aid the lord Charles of Blois, was aduertised, that
the king of England was with the most part of all his power withdrawen to Vannes, and
there laie at siege, sore constreining them within: wherefore he also drew thitherwards, and
approching to the place, incamped with his armie ouer against the king of England, inclosing
his field with a great trench. The king of England supposing he should haue battell,
sent vnto those which laie at siege before Rennes, commanding them to come from thence
vnto him: so that by this meanes all the powers, both of the king of England, and of the
duke of Normandie, generall to his father the French king in those warres of Britaine, being
assembled before Vannes, had fought some great and bloudie battell, as was supposed, for
the whole triall of the right of Britaine, if the cardinals of Cleremont and Prenesti, as legats
from pope Clement the sixt, had not taken vp the matter, by concluding a truce betwixt
them, for the tearme of thr&eacute;e yeares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce for thr&eacute;e yeares.</div>

<p>Commissioners appointed to treat with these cardinals, on the behalfe of the king of
England were these, Henrie of Lancaster earle of Derbie, William Bohun earle of Northampton,
William Montacute earle of Salisburie, Rafe lord Stafford, Bartholomew lord
Burghese, Nicholas lord Cantelow, Reginald lord Cobham, Walter lord of Mannie, Maurice
lord Berkeley, and maister Iohn Vfford archdeacon of Elie. For the French king,
Odo duke of Burgogne, and Piers duke of Burbon were deputed commissioners. Such
diligence was vsed by the parties, that finallie they agr&eacute;ed vpon this truce of thr&eacute;e yeares,
with certeine articles for meane to conclude some finall peace, as that there should be sent
from either king some personages of their bloud and others, vnto the court of Rome, with
sufficient authoritie, to agr&eacute;e, confirme, and establish vpon all controuersies and dissentions
betwixt the said kings, according to the agr&eacute;ement of the pope, and such as should be
so sent to treat thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conditions of the truce.</div>

<p>It was further agr&eacute;ed, that they should haue libertie to declare and pronounce their
arguments and reasons before the pope, but not to haue power to decide and giue sentence,
but onlie by waie of some better treatie and order of agr&eacute;ement to be made. And
these commissioners were appointed to appeare before the pope, afore the feast of saint
Iohn Baptist next insuing, and the pope to dispatch the businesse before Christmasse after,
if by consent of the said nobles, the terme were not proroged. And if it so were that the
pope could make no agr&eacute;ement, yet should the truce indure the prefixed terme, to wit,
till the feast of S. Michaell the archangell, and for the space of thr&eacute;e yeares then next
insuing, betwixt the kings of France, England and Scotland, the earle of Heinault and their
alies, as the dukes of Brabant, and of Gelderland, also the marques of Gullikerland, the
lord Beaumont, otherwise called sir Iohn de Heinault, and the people of Flanders, in all
their lands and dominions, from the date of the charter made hereof, by all the said
terme aforesaid, to be obserued, holden and kept. Also, the king of Scots, and the earle
of Heinault were appointed to send certeine persons, as commissioners for them, vnto the
said court of Rome.</p>

<p>This truce was also accorded to be kept in Britaine, betwixt the said kings and their
adherents, in which countrie, as well as in Guien, and other places, euerie man should
remaine in possession of that which he held at the time of concluding this truce, saue that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
the citie of Vannes should be deliuered into the hands of the cardinall, to be kept by them
in the popes name, during the truce, and then to dispose thereof, as should s&eacute;eme to them
good. Manie other articles were comprised in the charter of this truce, too long h&eacute;ere to
rehearse, all the which were confirmed with the oths of the said dukes of Burgoigne and
Burbone, on the French kings behalfe; and of the earles of Derbie, Northampton and
Salisburie, the lord Burghersts, and the lord of Mannie, for the king of England. In
witnesse whereof, the said cardinals caused the charter to be made, putting therevnto their
seales, the ninet&eacute;enth daie of Ianuarie, in the yeare 1343 in presence of diuerse prelats,
and of the earles of Bullongne, Ausserre, Sancerre, Iuignie, and Porcien, the lord Miles de
Nohers, the lord Ingram de Coucie, and the foresaid lords, Cantelowe, Cobham, and
Berkeley, with manie other lords, barons, nobles, and gentlemen.</p>

<p>When this truce was thus confirmed, manie of the English armie returned home through
France, so to passe ouer by the narrow seas into England, but the king himselfe, with a
few other, taking their ships to passe by long seas, were maruellouslie tormented by tempest,
so that their ships were scattered and driuen to take land at diuerse hauens. The
dutchesse of Britaine with hir sonne and daughter, came on land in Deuonshire. Sir
P&eacute;ers de V&eacute;ele, and his sonne sir Henrie V&eacute;ele, and sir Iohn Raine knights, were drowned,
togither with the ship in which they passed. The king escaping verie hardlie, landed
at Weimouth, and on the fift day of March came to London to the qu&eacute;ene. In the quindene
of Easter, he held a parlement at Westminster, in which he created his eldest sonne
Edward prince of Wales. In this parlement were diuerse matters talked of, and speciallie
concerning wools, and of the assessement of a certeine price of them, more and lesse,
according to the seuerall parts of the realme, and of the customes to be made of them, to
wit, thr&eacute;e marks and an halfe, for euerie sacke to be transported foorth of the realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors appointed to go to the pope.</div>

<p>Also in the same parlement were ambassadors appointed foorth, such as should go to
the pope to treat of peace (as in the charter of the truce among other articles it was
conteined) whose names follow, Iohn bishop of Excester, Henrie de Lancaster earle of
Derbie, Hugh le Dispenser lord of Glamorgan, cousins to the king; Rafe lord Stafford,
William de Norwich deane of Lincolne, William Trussell knight, and master Andrew de
Vfford a ciuillian. These persons were sent with commission to the pope, to treat with
him, not as pope, nor as iudge, but as a priuat person, and a common fr&eacute;end to both
parts, to be a meane or mediator, to find out some indifferent end of all controuersie betwixt
the parties. The date of their commission was at Westminster, the foure and
twentith of Maie, in this seauent&eacute;enth yeare of the kings reigne.</p>

<p>Moreouer, in this parlement a gr&eacute;euous complaint was exhibited, by the earles, barons,
knights, burgesses, and other of the commons, for that strangers, by vertue of reseruations
and prouisions apostolike, got the best benefices of this land into their hands, and neuer
came at them, nor bare any charges due for the same, but diminishing the treasure of the
realme, and conueieng it foorth, sore indamaged the whole state. The bishops durst not,
or would not giue their consents in exhibiting this complaint, but rather s&eacute;emed to stand
against it, till the king compelled them to giue ouer.</p>

<p>Herevpon, a letter was framed by the lords of the temporaltie and commons, which they
directed vnto the pope in all humble manner, bes&eacute;eching him to consider of the derogation
doone to the realme of England, by such reseruations, prouisions, and collations of
benefices, as had b&eacute;en practised here in England. And therefore sith the churches of
England had b&eacute;ene founded and endowed by noble and worthie men in times past, to the
end the people might be instructed by such as were of their owne language, and that he
being so farre off, and not vnderstanding the default, had (like as some of his predecessors
more than in times past had b&eacute;ene accustomed) granted by diuerse reseruations, prouisions,
and collations, the churches and spirituall promotions of this land vnto diuerse
persons, some strangers, yea, and enimies to the realme, whereby the monie and profits
were carried foorth, the cures not prouided for, almes withdrawne, hospitalitie decaied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
the temples and other buildings belonging to the churches ruinated and fallen downe,
the charitie and deuotion of the people sore diminished, and diuerse other gr&eacute;euous
enormities thereby growne cleane contrarie to the founders minds: wherefore,
vpon due consideration thereof had, they signified to him, that they could not suffer such
enormities any longer, &amp; therefore besought him wholie to reuoke such reseruations, prouisions,
collations, to auoid such slanders, misch&eacute;efes, and harmes as might insue, and that
the cures might therewith be committed to persons m&eacute;et for the exercise of the same:
further also, bes&eacute;eching him without delaie, to signifie his intention, sith they meant to
imploie their diligence to remedie the matter, and to s&eacute;e that redresse might be had
according to reason. The date of these letters was in full parlement at Westminster, the
eight and twentith of Maie, in the yeare of Grace 1343.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Iohn Shordich sent to the pope.</div>

<p>Beside these letters, were other written, and sent from the king, conteining in summe,
the tenor of the other aboue mentioned, and one sir Iohn Shordich, knight a graue personage
and well s&eacute;ene in the law, was appointed to go with the same, who comming to
Auignion, and there presenting his letters in the popes priuie chamber, where the pope
sat, with all his cardinals about him, receiued no great courteous welcome, after his
letters were once read. And whie? Euen bicause the c&#x014D;tents of the same misliked
his mind, tending to the impairing of his vsurped profits &amp; c&#x014D;modities from time to time

<div class="sidenote">The Popes words to Sir Iohn Shordich.</div>

<p>Now when the knight made answer to such words as he heard the pope vtter, and
charged him with giuing the deanrie of Yorke vnto one that was reputed the kings enimie,
the pope said; "Well, it is not vnknowne to vs who made and indited these letters, and
we know that thou madest them not, but there is one that pincheth at vs, and we shall
punish him well inough: we know all." Herevnto he added thus much more, that "there
was a knight that spake defamous words of him, and the church of Rome, wherewith he
s&eacute;emed highlie offended." To conclude, he said, "that he would answer the letters of the
king and commons, as touching the points conteined in the same." The cardinals, after
they had heard these things, departed as if they had b&eacute;ene sore offended and troubled
therewith: and the knight taking his leaue of the pope, departed also foorth of the chamber,
and without anie longer abode, got him awaie toward Burdeaux, about other of the
kings businesse, doubting least if he had staied longer, he might haue b&eacute;ene kept there
against his will. The pope sent answer ind&eacute;ed, but neuerthelesse, the king proc&eacute;eded in
prohibiting such prouisions, and collations within his realme, on paine of imprisonment
and death to the intrudors thereby, as after ye shall perceiue.</p>

<p>This yeare about Midsummer, there were solemne iusts proclaimed by the lord Robet
Morley, which were holden in Smithf&eacute;eld, where for challengers came foorth one apparelled
like to the pope, bringing with him twelue other in garments like to cardinals, which
tooke vpon them to answer all commers, for thr&eacute;e courses. On the defendants side, ran
the prince of Wales, with manie earls, barons, knights and esquires innumerable, so that
those iusts continued thr&eacute;e daies togither, to the great pleasure of the beholders. &para; This
yeare, king Edward ordeined a certeine new coine of gold, which he named the floren,
that is, the penie of six shillings eight pence, the halfe penie of the value of thr&eacute;e shillings
foure pence, and the farthing of the value of twentie pence. This coine was ordeined for
his wars in France, the gold whereof was not so fine as the noble, which in the fourt&eacute;enth
yeare of his reigne he had caused for to be coined. This yeare, the king caused a great
number of artificers and labourers to be taken vp, whome he set in hand to build a chamber
in the castell of Windsore, which was called the round table, the floore whereof, from
the center or middle point, vnto the compasse throughout, the one halfe was (as Walsingham
writeth) an hundred foot, and so the diameter or compasse round about, was two
hundred foot. The expenses of this worke amounted by the w&eacute;eke, first vnto an hundred
pounds, but afterward by reason of the wars that followed, the charges was diminished
vnto two and twentie pounds the w&eacute;eke (as Thomas Walsingham writeth in his larger
booke, intituled, the historie of England) or (as some copies haue) vnto 9 pounds. This
y&eacute;ere also, W. Montacute earle of Salisburie conquered the Ile of Man, out of the hands
of the Scots, which Ile the king gaue vnto the said earle, and caused him to be intituled,
and crowned king of Man. &para; This Ile (as Robert Southwell noteth) was woone by the
Scots, about the second yeare of Edward the second his reigne, who in the yeare before,
to wit, anno Christi 1307, had giuen the same Ile vnto P&eacute;ers de Gaueston, whom he had
also made earle of Cornewall.</p>

<p>Moreouer, about the beginning of this eight&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne, king Edward held
a solemne feast at his castell of Windsore, where betwixt Candlemasse and Lent, were
atchiued manie martiall feasts, and iusts, tornaments, and diuerse other the like warlike
pastimes, at the which were present manie strangers of other lands, and in the end thereof,
he deuised the order of the garter, and after established it, as it is at this daie. There
are six and twentie companions or confrers of this felowship of that order, being called
knights of the blew garter, &amp; as one dieth or is depriued, an other is admitted into his
place. The K. of England is euer ch&eacute;efe of this order. They weare a blew robe or
mantell, &amp; a garter about their left leg, richlie wrought with gold and pretious stones,
hauing this inscription in French vpon it, Honi soit qui mal y pense, Shame come to
him that euill thinketh. This order is dedicated to S. George, as ch&eacute;efe patrone of men
of warre, and therefore euerie yeare doo the knights of this order k&eacute;epe solemne his feast,
with manie noble ceremonies at the castell of Windsore, where king Edward founded a
colledge of canons, or rather augmenting the same, ordeined therein a deane with twelue
canons secular, eight peticanons, and thirt&eacute;ene vicars, thirt&eacute;ene clearks, and thirt&eacute;ene
choristers.</p>

<p>The knights haue certeine lawes and rules apperteining to their order, amongst the
which this is ch&eacute;eflie to be obserued (as Polydor also noteth) that they shall aid and
defend one another, and neuer turne their backes or runne awaie out of the field in time
of battell, where he is present with his souereigne lord, his lieutenant or deputie, or other
capteine, hauing the kings power roiall and authoritie, and whereas his banners, standards,
or pennons are spred. The residue of the lawes and rules apperteining vnto this noble

<div class="sidenote">The occasion that mooued K. Edward to institute the order of the garter.</div>

<p>&para; The cause and first originall of instituting this order is vncerteine. But there goeth
a tale amongst the people, that it rose by this means. It chanced that K. Edward finding
either the garter of the qu&eacute;ene, or of some<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> ladie with whom he was in loue, being fallen
from hir leg, stooped downe and tooke it vp, whereat diuerse of his nobles found matter
to iest, and to talke their fansies merilie, touching the kings affection towards the woman,
vnto whome he said, that if he liued, it should come so passe, that most high honor
should be giuen vnto them for the garters sake: and there vpon shortlie after, he deuised
and ordeined this order of the garter, with such a posie, wherby he signified, that his
nobles iudged otherwise of him than the truth was. Though some may thinke, that so
noble an order had but a meane beginning, if this tale be true, yet manie honorable degr&eacute;es
of estates haue had their beginnings of more base and meane things, than of loue,
which being orderlie vsed, is most noble and commendable, sith nobilitie it selfe is couered
vnder loue, as the poet Ouid aptlie saith,</p>

<p>William de Montacute earle of Salisburie king of Man, and marshall of England, was
so brused at the iusts holden here at Windsore (as before ye haue heard) that he departed
this life, the more was the pitie, within eight daies after. &para; The king about the same
time, to wit, in the quindene of Candlemasse, held a councell at London, in the which
with good aduise and sound deliberation had vpon the complaint of the commons to him
before time made, he gaue out streict commandement, that no man on paine of imprisonment
and death, should in time to come, present or induct anie such person or persons,
that were so by the pope promoted, without the kings agr&eacute;ement, in preiudice of his roiall
prerogatiue. H&eacute;erevpon, he directed also writs to all archbishops, bishops, abbats,
priors, deanes, archdeacons, officials and other ecclesiasticall persons, to whome it apperteined,
inhibiting them in no wise to attempt anie thing in preiudice of that ordinance,
vnder pretext of anie bulles, or other writings, for such manner of prouisions to come from
the court of Rome. Other writs were also directed to his sonne the prince of Wales, and
to all the shiriffes within the realme, for to arrest all such as brought into the land any
such buls or writings, and to bring them before the kings councell or his iustices, where
they might be punished according to the trespasse by them committed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coine changed.</div>

<p>About the same time, the king ordeined a certeine coine of fine gold, and named it the
floren, which coine was deuised for his warres in France, for the gold thereof was not so
fine as was the noble, which in the fourt&eacute;enth yeare he had caused to be coined: but this
coine continued not long. &para; After the feast of the holie Trinitie, the king held a parlement
at London, in the which he asked a tenth of the cleargie, and a fift&eacute;enth of the laitie, about
which demand there was no small altercation, but at length he had it granted for one
yeare. &para; At the same time, the archbishop of Canturburie held a conuocation of all the
cleargie at London, in the which manie things were in talke about the honest demeanor of
churchmen, which sildome is obserued, as the addition to Nicholas Triuet saith. About
the feast of the Assumption of our ladie, the king disanulled the florens, to the great commoditie
of his kingdome, ordeining a greater floren of halfe a marke, and a lesser of thr&eacute;e
shillings foure pence, and the least of all of twentie pence, and these were called nobles,
and not without cause, for they were a noble coine, of faire &amp; fine gold.</p>

<p>This yeare, on the seauent&eacute;enth daie of Nouember, the pope in Auinion created the lord
Lewes de Spaine, ambassador for the French king, prince of the Iles called Fortunat&aelig;, for
what purpose it was not knowne, but it was doubted, not to be for anie good meaning
towards the kingdome of England, the prosperitie whereof, the same pope was suspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>not greatlie to wish. &para; About the beginning of Lent the same yeare, the said pope had
sent an archbishop and a bishop, ambassadors to the king, who met them at Ospring in
Kent, and to the end they should not linger long within the realme, he quicklie dispatched
them without effect of their message. &para; This yeare, shortlie after Easter, the duke of
Britaine, that had b&eacute;ene deteined prisoner by the French king, and escaped out of
prison, came ouer into England. &para; And about the same time, the king ordeined the
exchange of monies at London, Canturburie, and Yorke, to the great commoditie of his
people.</p>

<p>About Midsummer, or (as other haue) Michaelmas, the earle of Derbie, with the earle

Codnore, and diuerse other lords, knights, and esquires, to the number of fiue or six hundred
men of armes, and as manie archers, sailed ouer into Gascoine, to assist the kings
subiects there against the Frenchmen. This earle of Derbie, being generall of the armie,
after his arriuall in Gascoine, about the beginning of December, wan the towne of Bergerat
by force, hauing put to flight the earle of Lisle, as then the French kings lieutenant in
Gascoine, who laie there with a great power, to defend the passage: but being driuen into
the towne, and hauing lost the suburbes to the Englishmen, he fled out in the night, and
so left the towne, without anie souldiers to defend it, so that the townesmen y&eacute;elded it
vnto the earle of Derbie, and sware themselues to be true liege men vnto the king of England.

and souldiers in such places as he had woone.</p>

<p>This yeare, the king sent foorth a commission vnto certeine persons in euerie countie
within the realme, to inquire what lands and tenements euerie man, aboue fiue pounds of
y&eacute;erelie reuenues, being of the laie f&eacute;e, might dispend; bicause he had giuen order, that
euerie man which might dispend fiue pounds and aboue, vnto ten pounds of such y&eacute;erelie
reuenues in land of the laie f&eacute;e, should furnish himselfe, or find an archer on horssebacke,
furnished with armour and weapon accordinglie. He that might dispend ten pounds,
should furnish himselfe, or find a demilance or light horsseman (if I shall so terme him)
being then called a hobler with a lance. And he that might dispend fiue and twentie
pounds, should furnish himselfe or find a man at armes. And he that might dispend fiftie
pounds, should furnish two men at arms. And he that might dispend an hundred pounds
should find thr&eacute;e men at armes, that is, himselfe, or one in his st&eacute;ed, with two other. And
such as might dispend aboue an hundred pounds, were appointed to find more in number
of men at armes, accordinglie as they should be assessed, after the rate of their lands,
which they might yearelie dispend, being of the laie f&eacute;e, and not belonging to the
church.</p>

<p>About this season, the duke of Britaine, hauing with him the earles of Northampton

and knights, with a great number of men of armes, passed ouer into Britaine, against the

after their comming from thence, sir Thomas Dagworth knight, that had b&eacute;ene before, and

<p>In this ninet&eacute;enth yeare of king Edward I find, that about the feast of the Natiuitie of
saint Iohn Baptist, he sailed ouer into Flanders, leauing his sonne the lord Lionell, warden
of the realme in his absence. He tooke with him a great number of lords, knights,
and gentlemen, with whome he landed at Sluse. The cause of his going ouer was, to further
a practise which he had in hand with them of Flanders, the which by the labour of
Iaques Arteueld, meant to cause their earle Lewes, either to doo homage vnto king Edward;
or else if he refused, then to disherit him, and to receiue Edward prince of Wales
for their lord, the eldest sonne of king Edward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A councell holden in the king of Englands ship.</div>

<p>King Edward promising to make a dukedome of the countie of Flanders, for an augmentation
of honour to the countrie, there came vnto Sluse to the king, Iaques van Arteueld,
and a great number of other, appointed as councellors for their ch&eacute;efest townes. The
king with all his nauie lay in the hauen of Sluse, where, in his great ship called the Catharine,
a councell was holden vpon this foresaid purpose: but at length, those of the councellors
of the ch&eacute;efest townes misliked the matter so much, that they would conclude
nothing, but required respit for a moneth, to consult with all the comunaltie of the countries
and townes, and as the more part should be inclined, so should the king receiue answer.
The king and Iaques Arteueld would faine haue had a shorter daie, and a more towardlie
answer, but none other could be gotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Welshmen appointed to Iaques Arteueld for a gard against Gerard Denise.</div>

<p>Herevpon the councell brake vp, and Iaques Arteueld tarieng with the king a certeine
space, after the other were departed, promised him to persuade the countrie well inough
to his purpose, and suerlie, he had a great gift of eloquence, and had thereby induced the
countrie wonderfullie, to consent to manie things, as well in fauour of king Edward, as to
his owne aduancement: but this suit which he went now about to bring to passe, was so
odious vnto all the Flemings, that in no wise they thought it reason to consent vnto the
disheriting of the earle. At length, when Iaques Arteueld should returne vnto Gant, king
Edward appointed fiue hundred Welshmen to attend him as a gard, for the preseruation of
his person, bicause he said, that one Gerard Denise deane of the weauers, an vnquiet man,
maliciouslie purposed his destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iacob Arteuelds house beset.</div>

<p>Capteins of these Welshmen were Iohn Matreuers, and William Sturine or Sturrie, and
so with this crue of souldiers Arteueld returned vnto Gant, and earnestlie went in hand with
his suit in king Edwards behalfe, that either the earle should doo his homage to the king of
England to whome it was due; or else to forfeit his earledome. Then the foresaid Gerard,
as well of his owne mind, as procured thereto by the authoritie of earle Lewes, stirred the
whole citie against the said Arteueld, and gathering a great power vnto him, came and
beset Arteuelds house round about vpon each side, the furie of the people being wonderfullie
bent against him, crieng; "Kill him, Kill him that hath robbed the tresurie of the
countrie, and now goeth about to disherit our noble earle."</p>

could not be: whervpon he sought to haue fled out of his house, but the same was broken
vp, and so manie entred vpon him, that he was found out, and slaine by one Thomas Denise
(as some write.) But other affirme, that on a sundaie in the after noone, being the 17 of
Iulie, a cobler, whose father this Iaques van Arteueld had sometime slaine, followed him,
as he was fl&eacute;eing into a stable where his horsses stood, &amp; there with an ax cloue his head
asunder, so that he fell downe starke dead on the ground. And this was the end of the
foresaid Iaques van Arteueld, who by his wisdome and policie had obteined the whole

<p>There were slaine also ten other persons that were of his councell, and diuerse of the

remaining at Sluse, vnto whome those of Bruges, Cassell, Curtrike, Ypres, Aldenard, and
other townes, did afterwards sent their orators to excuse themselues, as nothing guiltie nor
priuie to the death of his fr&eacute;end, and their worthie gouernor Iaques van Arteueld, requiring
him not to impute the fault vnto the whole countrie, which the rash and vnaduised
Gantiners had committed, sith the countrie of Flanders was as readie now to doo him
seruice and pleasure as before, sauing that to the disheriting of their earle they could not
be agr&eacute;eable, but they doubted not to persuade him to doo his homage vnto the king of
England, and till then they promised not to receiue him. They put the king also in hope
of a mariage to be had, betwixt the sonne of their earle, and some one of the kings
daughters. Herewith the king of England (who was departed from Sluse, in great displeasure
with the Flemings) became somewhat pacified in his mood, and so renewed the
league eftsoons with the countrie of Flanders: but the earle would neuer consent to doo
homage vnto the king of England, but still sticked to the French kings part, which purchased
him much trouble, and in the end cost him his life, as after shall appeare.</p>

he had made of Bergerat, and other townes thereabouts; the earle of Lisle, who (as ye
haue heard) was the French kings lieutenant in that countrie, assembled an armie of
twelue thousand men, &amp; comming before Auberoch, (a towne in Gascoigne) besieged it,
sore pressing them within, in somuch that they were in great danger to haue b&eacute;ene taken,
if the earle of Derbie, hauing knowlege in what case they stood, had not come to their
rescue, who with thr&eacute;e hundred speares or men of armes, as we maie call them, and six
hundred archers, approching n&eacute;ere to the siege, laid himselfe closelie within a wood, till
the Frenchmen in the euening were at supper, &amp; then suddenlie set vpon them in their
campe, and discomfited them, so that the earle of Lisle was taken in his owne tent, and
sore hurt. There were also taken the earle of Valentinois, and other earles, vicounts, and
lords of great accompt, to the number of nine, besides those that were slaine. The residue

<p>After this, the earle of Derbie, being returned to Burdeaux, and hauing put the captiues

Rioll (a towne in those parts which he meant to besiege) he wan diuerse towns and castels
by the way, as saint Basill, Roch, Million, Montsegure, Aguillon, &amp; Segart. At length
he came to the towne of the Rioll, which he besieged, and laie about it nine w&eacute;ekes yer he
could win it, and then was the same towne surrendered into his hands, but the castell was
still defended against him for the space of eleuen w&eacute;ekes, at which time being sore
oppressed &amp; vndermined, it was y&eacute;elded by them within conditionallie, that they should
depart onelie with their armour. After this, the earle of Derbie wan Montpesance,
Mauleon, Ville-Franche in Agenois, Miremont, Thomines, the castell of Damassen, and
at length came before the citie of Angolesme the which made appointment with the earle,
that if no succors came from the French king within the space of a moneth, that then the
citie should be surrendered to the king of Englands vse: and to assure this appointment,
they deliuered to the earle foure and twentie of their ch&eacute;efe citizens as hostages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Blaues.</div>

<p>In the meane time, the earle laid siege to Blaues, but could not win it. His men rode

returned againe to the siege of Blaues. Now when the month was expired, that they of
Angolesme should y&eacute;eld, the earle sent his two marshals thither, who receiued the homage
and fealtie of the citizens, in the king of Englands name, and so they were in peace, and
receiued againe their hostages. At length when the earle of Derbie saw that he did but

<p>The French king being sore moued at the conquests thus atchiued by the earle of
Derbie, raised a mightie armie, and sent the same foorth, vnder the leading of his sonne
the duke of Normandie, into Gascoigne, to resist the said earle, and to recouer againe
those townes which he had woone in those parts. The duke of Normandie being come
to Tholouz, where generall assemblie was appointed, set forward with his armie, and
winning by the waie Miremount, and Ville Franche in Agenois; at length came to the
citie of Angolesme, which he inuironed about with a strong siege, continuing the same,
till finallie, the capiteine named Iohn Normell, required a truce to indure for one daie,
which was granted, and the same was the daie of the Purification of our ladie, on the
which, the same capiteine, with the souldiers of the garrison departed, and left the citie
in the citizens hands. The Frenchmen, bicause they had granted the truce to indure
for that daie without exception, permitted them to go their waies without let or vexation.
The citizens in the morning y&eacute;elded the citie to the duke. After this, he wan the castell
of Damassen, Thonins, and Port S. Marie; Thonins by surrender, and the other two by
force of assaults. Then he came to the strong castell of Aiguillon, which he besieged,
and laie thereat a long season. Within was the earle of Penbroke, the lord Walter de
Mannie, sir Franke de Halle, and diuerse knights and capteins, which defended themselues,
and the place so stoutlie, that the Frenchmen could win little aduantage at their
hands.</p>

<p>Whilest the siege continued before this fortresse, the seneshall of Guien departed from

win a castell, belonging to a nephue of the cardinall Della Motte, a twelue leagues
distant from Aiguillon. The archdeacon of Vnfort, owner of that castell, went to the
Rioll, where the earle of Derbie with his armie as then was lodged, to whome he made
suit, to haue some power of men to rescue his castell. The earle appointed to him a
sufficient number, both of horssemen, and also of English archers, with whome the said
archdeacon rode all the night, and the next morning betimes, being the one and thirtith
of Iulie, they came to the castell where the Frenchmen were arriued the daie before, and
had fiercelie assailed the castell, dooing their best to win it by force. But the Englishmen
without anie delaie, immediatlie vpon their comming, set vpon the Frenchmen, and
gaue them so sharpe and fierce battell, that in the end, the Frenchmen were discomfited:
the seneshall with manie other gentlemen were taken prisoners, beside those that were
slaine. To conclude, the number of them that were slaine, and taken prisoners
in the whole, amounted to foure hundred horssemen, and two thousand footmen. Sir
Godfrey de Harcourt being constreined to fl&eacute;e out of France, to auoid the French kings
displeasure, came ouer vnto the king of England, who receiued him verie ioifullie, for
he was knowne to be a right valiant and a wise personage. He was brother to the earle
of Harecourt, lord of saint Sauiour le Vicount, and of diuerse other townes in Normandie.
A little before that he fell into the French kings displeasure, he might haue
doone with the king of France, more than anie other lord within that realme.</p>

against purueiours of vittels for his houshold (the which vnder colour of their commissions,
abused the same, in taking vp among the commons all manner of things that liked
them, without making paiment for the same, further than the said commissions did allow
them) he caused inquirie to be made of their misdemeanors, and such as were found to
haue offended, of whome there was no small number, some of them were put to death on
the gallowes, and other were fined, so to teach the rest to deale more warilie in their
businesse from thenceforth. &para; About the same time, he caused all the iustices within his
dominions to renounce and giue ouer all their pensions, f&eacute;es, and other bribing benefits
and rewards, which they vsed to receiue of the lords and great men of the land, as well
prelats, as of them of the temporaltie, to the end that their hands being fr&eacute;e from gifts,
iustice might more fr&eacute;elie haue course, and be of them dulie and vprightlie ministred.
Also this yeare in the Lent season, the king held a parlement at Westminster, and tooke
into his hands all the profits, reuenues, and emoluments, which the cardinals held within
this land: for he thought it not reason, that they which fauoured the pope and the French

folowed the host on foot. The ch&eacute;efest capteins that went ouer with him were these.
First his eldest sonne Edward prince of Wales, being as then about the age of thirt&eacute;ene

the lords, Iohn, Lewes, and Roger Beauchampe; also the lords Cobham, Mowbraie,

Godfrey of Harecourt, in the Ile of Constantine, at the port of Haguc saint Wast, n&eacute;ere

<p>After that the whole armie was landed, the king appointed two marshals, the lord Godfrey

There were ordeined thr&eacute;e battels, one to go on his right hand, following by the
coast of the sea; and another to march on his left hand, vnder the conduct of the marshals;
so that he himselfe went in the middest with the maine armie, and in this order
forward they passed towards Caen, lodging euerie night togither in one field. They that
went by the sea, tooke all the ships they found in their waie, and as they marched foorth
thus, what by water &amp; land, at length they came to a towne called Harflew, which was
giuen vp, but yet neuerthelesse it was robbed, and much goods found in it. After this
they came to Chierburge, which towne they wan by force, robbed it, and burnt part of it,
but the castell they could not win. Then came they to Mountburge and tooke it, robbed
it &amp; burnt it cleane. In this manner they passed foorth, and burnt manie towns and
villages in all the countrie as they went. The towne of Carentine was deliuered vnto
them against the will of the soldiers that were within it. The soldiers defended the
castell two daies, and then y&eacute;elded it vp into the Englishmens hands, who burnt the
same, and caused the burgesses to enter into their ships. All this was doone by the
battell that went by the sea side, and by them on the sea togither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saint Lo.</div>

<p>On the other side, the lord Godfrie of Harecourt, with the battell on the right hand of
the king, road foorth six or seuen leagues from the kings battell, in burning and exiling
the countrie. The king had with him (beside those that were with the marshals) 3000
men of armes, six thousand archers, and ten thousand men on foot. They left the citie
of Constance, and came to a great towne called saint Lo, a rich towne of draperie, hauing
manie wealthie burgesses within it: it was soone taken and robbed by the Englishmen
vpon their first approch. From thence the king marched streight to Caen, wherein were
capteins Rafe earle of Ewe and Guines constable of France, &amp; the earle of Tankeruile.
These noble men meant to haue kept their defenses on the walles, gate, bridge, and riuer,
and to haue left the suburbes void, bicause they were not closed, but onelie with the
riuer: but they of the towne said they would issue forth, for they were strong inough to
fight with the king of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[Pg 635]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">There were slaine in all without and within the towne 5000 men, as <i>Gio. Villani</i> writeth.</div>

<p>When the constable saw their good willes, he was contented to follow their desire, and

when they saw the Englishmen approch in good order, diuided into thr&eacute;e battels, &amp; the
archers readie to shoot, which they of Caen had not s&eacute;ene before, they were sore afraid,
and fled awaie toward the towne without any order or arraie, for all that the constable
could doo to staie them. The Englishmen followed, and in the chase slue manie, and
entered the towne with their enimies. The constable, and the earle of Tankeruile tooke
a tower at the bridge foot, thinking there to saue themselues, but perceiuing the place to
be of no force, nor able long to hold out, they submitted themselues vnto sir Thomas
Holland. &para; But here whatsoeuer Froissard dooth report of the taking of this tower,
and of the y&eacute;elding of these two noble men, it is to be proued that the said earle of Tankeruile
was taken by one surnamed Legh, ancestor to sir Peter Legh now liuing, whether
in the fight or within the tower, I haue not to saie: but for the taking of the said earle,
and for his other manlike prowes shewed here and elsewhere in this iournie, king Edward
in recompense of his agr&eacute;eable seruice, gaue to him a lordship in the countie of Chester
called Hanley, which the said sir Peter Legh now liuing dooth inioy and possesse, as
successor and heire to his ancestor the foresaid Legh, to whom it was so first giuen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Caen taken.</div>

<div class="sidenote">40000 clothes, as <i>Gio. Villani</i> writeth, were got by the Englishmen in one place and other in this iournie.</div>

their houses, cast downe vpon the Englishmen below in the str&eacute;ets, stones, timber, hot
water, and barres of iron, so that they hurt and slue more than fiue hundred persons.
The king was so mooued therewith, that if the lord Godfrie of Harecourt had not
asswaged his mood, the towne had b&eacute;ene burnt, and the people put to the edge of the
sword: but by the treatie of the said lord Godfrie, proclamation was made, that no man
should put fire into any house, nor slea any person, nor force any woman, and then did
the townesmen and souldiers submit themselues, and receiued the Englishmen into their
houses. There was great store of riches gotten in this towne, and the most part thereof
sent into England, with the fl&eacute;et which the king sent home with the prisoners, vnder the
guiding of the earle of Huntington, accompanied with two hundred men of armes, and

in the same order as he had kept before, burning and exiling the countrie. He passed
by Eureux &amp; came to Louiers, which the Englishmen soone entred and sacked without
mercie. Then went they foorth and left Roan, and came to Gisors, the towne they
burnt, but the castell they could not get: they burnt also Vernon, and at Poissie they
repared the bridge which was broken, and so there they passed ouer the riuer of Saine.
The power of the Englishmen increased dailie, by such numbers as came ouer foorth of
England in hope to win by pillage. Also manie gentlemen of Normandie, and other of
the French nation, which loued not nor owght any good will vnto the French king, came
to the king of England, offering to serue him, so that there were in his armie foure thousand
horssemen and fiftie thousand footmen with the Normans, and of this number there
were thirtie thousand English archers, as Giouan Villani writeth. The English marshals
ran abroad iust to Paris, and burnt S. Germans in Laie: also Mountioy, and S. Clowd,
and petie Bullongne by Paris, &amp; the qu&eacute;enes Burge. In the meane time had the French
king assembled a mightie armie vpon purpose to fight with the Englishmen. &para; The lord
Godfrey of Harecourt, as he rode foorth with fiue hundred men of armes, and 13 hundred
archers, by aduenture incountered with a great number of the burgesses of Amiens
on horssebacke, who were riding by the kings commandement to Paris. They were
quickelie assailed, and though they defended themselues manfullie for a while, yet at
length they were ouercome, and eleuen hundred of them slaine in the field, beside those
that were taken. The Englishmen had all their cariage and armour. Thus passed
foorth the king of England, and came into Beauuoisin, and lodged n&eacute;ere vnto the citie of
Beauuois one night in an abbeie called Messene, and for that after he was dislodged,
there were that set fire in the same abbeie, without any commandement giuen by him; he
caused twentie of them to be hanged that were the first procurers of that fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piqueney.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French kings armie.</div>

<p>So long the king of England passed forward, that finallie he approched n&eacute;ere to the
water of Some, the which was large and d&eacute;epe, and all the bridges broken and the passages
well kept, wherevpon he caused his two marshals with a thousand men of armes, &amp;
two thousand archers, to go along the riuer, to the end to find some passage. The marshals
assaied diuerse places, as at Piqueney, and other where, but they could not find any
passage vnclosed, capteins with men of warre being set to defend the same, in somuch
that the marshalls returned to the king, and declared what they had s&eacute;ene and found.
At the same instant time was the French king come to Amiens, with more than a hundred
thousand men, and thought to inclose the king of England, that he should no waie escape,
but be constreined to receiue battell in some place greatlie to his disaduantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Godmare du Foy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Gobin Agace.</div>

<p>The king of England well perceiuing himselfe in danger, remooued from the place
where he was incamped, and marched forward through the countries of Pontiew and
Vimew, approching vnto the good towne of Abuile, and at length by one of the prisoners
named Gobin de Grace, he was told where he might passe with his armie ouer the riuer
of Some, at a foord in the same riuer, being hard in the bottome, and verie shallow at
an eb water. The French king vnderstanding that the K. of England sought to passe the
riuer of Some, sent a great baron of Normandie, one sir Godmare du Foy, to defend the
passage of the same riuer, with a thousand men of armes, and six thousand on foot with
the Genowaies. This sir Godmare had with him also a great number of them of Mutterell
and others of the countrie, so that he had in all to the number of twelue thousand
men, one and other, and hearing that the king of England was minded to passe at
Blanchetake (which was the passage that Gobin Agace had informed the king of England
of) he came thither. When the Englishmen approched, he arranged all his companie
to defend the passage.</p>

<p>And suerlie when the Englishmen at the lowe water entred the foord to passe ouer,
there was a sharpe bickering, for diuerse of the Frenchmen incountred the Englishmen
on horssebacke in the water, and the Genowaies did them much hurt, and troubled them
sore with their crosbowes: but on the other side, the English archers shot so wholie
togither, that the Frenchmen were faine to giue place to the Englishmen, so that they got
the passage and came ouer, assembling themselues in the field, and then the Frenchmen
fled, some to Abuile, some to saint Riquier. They that were on foot could not escape so
well as those on horssebacke, insomuch that a great number of them of Abuile, Mutterell,
Arras, and S. Riquier were slaine and taken, for the chase indured more than a great
league. There were slaine in all to the number of two thousand. When the K. of England
had thus passed the riuer, he acquitted Gobin Agace, and all his companie of their
ransomes, and gaue to the same Gobin an hundred nobles, and a good horsse, and so the
king rode foorth as he did before. His marshals road to Crotaie by the sea side, and
burnt the towne, and tooke all such wines and goods as were in the ships and barks which
laie there in the hauen.</p>

<p>One of the marshals road to the gates of Abuile, and from thence to S. Riquier, and
after to the towne of Rue saint Esperit. This was on a fridaie, and both the marshals
returned to the kings host about noone, and so lodged all togither about Cressie in
Pontiew, where hauing knowledge that the French king followed to giue him battell, he
commanded his marshalls to choose a plot of ground, somewhat to his aduantage, that he
might there abide his aduersaries. In the meane time the French king being come with
all his puissance vnto Abuile, and hearing how the king of England was passed ouer the
riuer of Some, and discomfited sir Godmare du Foy, was sore displeased in his mind:
but when he vnderstood that his enimies were lodged at Cressie, and meant there to abide
him, he caused all his people to issue out of Abuile, and earlie on the saturdaie in the
morning, anon after sunne rising he departed out of the towne himselfe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
marched towards his enimies. The king of England vnderstanding that his aduersarie
king Philip still followed him, to giue him battell, &amp; supposing that the same saturdaie he
would come to offer it, rose betimes in the morning, and commanded euerie man first to
call vpon God for his aid, then to be armed, and to draw with sp&eacute;ed into the field, that
in the place before appointed they might be set in order of battell. Beginning his enterprise
at inuocation or calling vpon God, he was the more fortunate in his affaires, and
sped the better in the progresse of his actions, as the issue of the warre shewed. A notable
example to euerie priuat man, to remember to call vpon God when he purposeth
anie thing, for as the poet saith, and that verie christianlie,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Giov&#x014D; Villani</i> saith, that when they should ioine in battell, the Englishmen were 30000 archers English &amp; Welsh, beside other footmen with axes &amp; iauelins, and not fullie 4000 horssemen.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Froissard.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The kings demeanor before y<sup>e</sup> battell.</div>

<p>Beside this, he caused a parke to be made and closed by the wood side behind his host,
in the which he ordeined that all the carts and carriages should be set, with all the horsses
(for euerie man was on foot.) Then he ordeined thr&eacute;e battels, in the first was the prince
of Wales, and with him the earle of Warwike, the lord Godfrey of Harecourt, the lord
Stafford, the lord de la Ware, the lord Bourchier, the lord Thomas Clifford, the lord
Reginald Cobham, the lord Thomas Holland, sir Iohn Chandos, sir Bartholomew de
Browash, sir Robert Neuill. They were eight hundred men of armes, and two thousand
archers, and a thousand of other with the Welsh men. In the second battell was the earle
of Northhampton, the earle of Arundell, the lords Ros and Willowbie, Basset, S. Albine,
Multon, and others. The third battell the king led himselfe, hauing with him seauen
hundred men of armes, and two thousand archers, and in the other battell were to the
number of eight hundred men of armes, and twelue hundred archers. Thus was the
English armie marshalled according to the report of <i>Froissard.</i> When euerie man was
gotten into order of battell, the king leapt vpon a white hobbie, and rode from ranke to
ranke to view them, the one marshall on his right hand, and the other on his left, desiring
euerie man that daie to haue regard to his right and honour. He spake it so courteouslie,
and with so good a countenance, that euen they which before were discomforted, tooke
courage in hearing him speake such sw&eacute;et and louing words amongst them. It was
nine of the clocke yer euer he had thus visited all his battels, &amp; therevpon he caused
euerie man to eat and drinke a little, which they did at their leisure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The disorders among the Frenchmen.</div>

<p>The French king before he approched n&eacute;ere to his enimies, sent foorth foure skilful
knights to view the demeanor of his enimies, the which returning againe, made report as
they had s&eacute;ene, and that forsomuch as they could gesse, the Englishmen ment to abide
him, being diuided into thr&eacute;e battels, readie to receiue him and his puissance, if he went
forward, in purpose to assaile them. Here was the French king counselled to stay and
not to giue battell that day, but to aduise all things with good deliberation and regard, to
consider well how and what way he might best assaile them. Then by the marshals were
all men commanded to staie, and not to go anie further, they that were formost and next
to the enimies taried, but they that were behind would not abide but rode foorth, and
said they would not staie till they were as far as the formost: and when they before saw
them behind come forward, then they marched on also againe, so that neither the K.
nor his marshals could rule them, but that they passed forward still without order, or anie
good arraie, till they came in sight of their enimies: and as soone as the formost saw their
enimies, then they reculed backe, whereof they behind had maruell, and were abashed,
supposing that the formost companie had b&eacute;ene fighting. Then they might haue had
roome to haue gone forward, if they had b&eacute;ene minded. The commons, of whome all
the waies betwixt Abuile and Cressie were full, when they saw that they were n&eacute;ere their
enimies, they tooke their swords and cried; "Downe with them, Let vs slea them all."
There was no man, though he were present at the iornie, that could imagine or shew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
truth of the euill order that was among the French partie, and yet they were a maruellous
great number.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Froissard.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Alanson.</div>

<p>The Englishmen which beheld their enimies thus approching them, prepared themselues
at leisure for the battell, which they saw to be at hand. The first battell, whereof the
prince was ruler, had the archers standing in maner of an herse, and the men of armes in
the botome of the battell. The earle of Northampton and the earle of Arundell with the
second battell were on a wing in good order, readie to comfort the princes battell if
n&eacute;ed were. The lords and knights of France came not to the assemblie togither, for
some came after, in such hast and euill order, that one of them troubled another.
There were of Genowaies crosbowes to the number of twelue or fift&eacute;ene thousand, the
which were commanded to go on before, and with their shot to begin the battell; but
they were so werie with going on foot that morning six leagues armed with their crosbowes,
that they said to their constables; "We be not well vsed, in that we are commanded
to fight this daie, for we be not in case to doo any great feat of armes, we haue
more n&eacute;ed of rest." These words came to the hearing of the earle of Alanson, who said;
"A man is well at ease to be charged with such a sort of rascals, that faint and faile
now at most n&eacute;ed."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Raine and thunder with an eclipse.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Genowaies.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The battell is begun.</div>

<p>Also at the same instant there fell a great raine, and an eclipse with a terrible thunder,
and before the raine, there came flieng ouer both armies a great number of crowes, for
feare of the tempest comming: then anon the aire began to wax cleare, and the sunne to
shine faire and bright, which was right in the French mens eies, and on the Englishmens
backs. &para; When the Genowaies were assembled togither, and began to approch, they
made a great leape and crie, to abash the Englishmen, but they stood still and stirred not
at all for that noise. Then the Genowaies the second time made an other leape and
huge crie, and stepped forward a little, and the Englishmen remooued not a foot. The
third time againe the Genowaies leapt, and yelled, and went foorth till they came within
shot, and fiercelie therwith discharged their crossbowes. Then the English archers stept
foorth one pase, and let flie their arrowes so wholie and so thicke togither, that it s&eacute;emed
to snowe. When the Genowaies felt the arrowes persing their heads, armes and breasts,
manie of them cast downe their crosbowes, and cut the strings, and returned discomfited.
When the French king saw them fl&eacute;e awaie, he said: "Slea these rascals, for they
will let and trouble vs without reason."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of Boheme.</div>

<p>Then ye might haue s&eacute;ene the men of armes haue dasht in amongst them, and killed a
great number of them, and euer the Englishmen shot where they saw the thickest
prease: the sharpe arrowes ran into the men of armes, and into their horsses, and manie
fell horsse and man amongst the Genowaies, and still the Englishmen shot where they
saw the thickest prease, and when they were once downe they could not recouer againe.
The throng was such that one ouerthrew another; &amp; also among the Englishmen, there
were certeine of the footmen with great kniues, that went in among the men of armes,
and killed manie of them as they laie on the ground, both earles, barons, knights, and
esquires. The valiant king of Bohem being almost blind, caused his men to fasten all
the reines of the bridels of their horsses ech to other, and so he being himselfe amongst
them in the formost ranke, they ran on their enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Alanson.</div>

<p>The lord Charles of Boheme sonne to the same king and late elected emperour, came
in good order to the battell, but when he saw how the matter went awrie on their part,
he departed and saued himselfe. His father by the meanes aforesaid went so far forward,
that ioining with his enimies he fought right valiantlie, and so did all his companie: but
finallie being entred within the prease of their enimies, they were of them inclosed and
slaine, togither with the king their master, and the next daie found dead lieng about him,
and their horsses all tied ech to other. The earle of Alanson came right orderlie to the
battell, and fought with the Englishmen, and so did the earle of Flanders also on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
part. These two lords coasted the English archers, and came to the princes battell, and
there fought right valiantlie a long time. The French king perceiuing where their banners
stood, would faine haue come to them, but could not, by reason of a great hedge
of archers that stood betwixt them and him. This was a perillous battell and sore
foughten: there were few taken to mercie, for the Englishmen had so determined in the
morning.</p>

<p>Certeine Frenchmen and Almaines perforce opened the archers of the princes battell,
and came to fight with the men of armes hand to hand. Then the second battell of the
Englishmen came to succor the princes battell, and not before it was time, for they of
that battell had as then inough to doo, in somuch that some which were about him, as the
earle of Northampton, and others sent to the king, where he stood aloft on a windmill
hill, requiring him to aduance forward, and come to their aid, they being as then sore
laid to of their enimies. The king herevpon demanded if his sonne were slaine, hurt, or
felled to the earth? "No (said the knight that brought the message) but he is sore
matched." "Well" (said the king) "returne to him and them that sent you, and saie to them
that they send no more to me for any aduenture that falleth, so long as my son is aliue, for
I will that this iournie be his, with the honor thereof." With this answer the knight returned,
which greatlie incouraged them to doo their best to win the spurs, being half abashed in
that they had so sent to the king for aid. At length when it drew toward euening, and that
the Frenchmen were beaten downe and slaine on ech hand, king Philip as it were by constreint
departed out of the field, not hauing as then past thr&eacute;e score persons about him, of
whome the lord Iohn of Heinault was one, by whose persuasion he ch&eacute;efelie consented to
ride his waie for his owne safegard, when he saw the losse was such as on that daie it could
not be recouered.</p>

<p>The slaughter of the Frenchmen was great and lamentable, namelie for the losse of so
manie noble men, as were slaine at the same battell, fought betw&eacute;ene Cressie and Broy on
the saturdaie next following the feast of saint Bartholomew being (as that yeare fell) the
26 of August. Among other which died that daie, these I find registred by name as
ch&eacute;efest, Iohn king of Boheme, Rafe duke of Lorraine, Charles of Alanso brother germane
to king Philip, Charles earle of Blois, Lewes earle of Flanders, also the earle of Harecourt,
brother to the lord Geffrie of Harecourt, with the earles of Ausserre, Aumerle, and saint
Poule, beside diuerse other of the nobilitie. The Englishmen neuer brake out of their
battels to chase any man, but kept themselues togither in their wards and ranks, and
defended themselues euer against such as came to assaile them. This battell ended about
euening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of England commeth downe from the hill.</div>

<p>When the Frenchmen were clearelie ouercome, and those that were left aliue fled and
gone, so that the Englishmen heard no more noise of them, king Edward came downe
from the hill (on the which he stood all that day with his helmet still on his head) and
going to the prince, imbraced him in his armes, and kissed him, saieng; "Faire sonne,
God send you good perseuerence in this your prosperous beginning, you haue noblie
acquit your selfe, you are well worthie to haue the gouernance of a realme committed to
your hands for your valiant dooings." The prince inclined himselfe to the earth in
honouring his father, as he best could. This done, they thanked God togither with their
souldiers for their good aduenture. For so the king commanded, and willed no man to
make anie boast of his owne power, but to ascribe all the praise to almightie God for such
a noble victorie; s&eacute;eming h&eacute;erein to be affected as Dauid was in the foure and fortith
psalme; for he also referreth the happie successe of warre, and all victorie, vnto Almightie
God, and not to the strength of a multitude of men, saieng:</p>

<p>&para; On the sundaie in the morning, there was such a mist, that a man could not s&eacute;e an
acres bredth before him. Then by the kings commandement there departed from the host
fiue hundred speares, and two thousand archers, to trie if they might heare of anie Frenchmen
gathered togither in anie place n&eacute;ere vnto them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frenchmen slaine the day after the battell.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The archb. of Rouen and the lord grand prior of France slaine.</div>

<p>On the same morning there were departed out of Abuile and S. Requier in Pontiew, the
commons of Roan and Beauuais, with other that knew nothing of the discomfiture the
daie before. These met with the Englishmen, supposing they had b&eacute;ene Frenchmen, and
being fiercelie assailed of them, after sore fight, and great slaughter, the Frenchmen were
discomfited and fled, of whome were slaine in the hedges and bushes, more than seuen
thousand men. The archbishop of Roan, and the grand prior of France, ignorant also of
the discomfiture the day before, &amp; supposing (as they were informed) the French should
not haue foughten till that sundaie, were likewise incountred (as they came thitherward)
by the Englishmen, with whome they fought a sore battell, for they were a great number,
but yet at length they were not able to susteine the puissant force of the Englishmen, and
so the most part of them were slaine, with the said archbishop and grand prior, and few
there were that escaped.</p>

<p>On that sundaie morning, the Englishmen met with diuerse Frenchmen, that had lost
their waie on the saturdaie, and wist not where the king nor their capteins were become.
They were all slaine in manner, so manie as the Englishmen could m&eacute;et with, insomuch
that of the commons and footmen of the cities and good townes of France (as was thought)
there were slaine this sundaie foure times as manie as were slaine on the saturdaie in the
great battell. When those Englishmen that were sent abroad thus to view the countrie,
were returned againe, and signified to the king what they had s&eacute;ene and doone, and how
there was no more appearance of the enimies, the king to search what the number was of
them that were slaine, and vpon the view taken, it was reported vnto him, that there were
found dead eleuen princes, foure score baronets, 12 hundred knights, and more than
thirtie thousand other of the meaner sort. Thus was the whole puissance of France
vanquished, and that ch&eacute;eflie by force of such as were of no reputation amongst them, that
is to say, the English archers, by whose sharpe and violent shot the victorie was atchiued,
to the great confusion of the French nation. &para; Of such price were the English bowes in
that season, that nothing was able to withstand them; whereas now our archers couet not
to drawe long and strong bowes, but rather to shoot compasse, which are not m&eacute;et for the
warres, nor greatlie to be feared, though they come into the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Calis besieged.</div>

<p>The king of England with his armie kept still his field, vntill mondaie in the morning,
and then dislodged, and came before Motur&eacute;ell by the sea, and his marshals ran towards
Hedin. The next daie they road toward Bullongne, &amp; at Wisam the king and the prince
incamped, and tarried a whole daie to refresh their people, and on the wednesdaie being
the thirtith day of August, he came before the strong towne of Calis, and there planted his
siege, and erected bastides betw&eacute;ene the towne and the riuer, and caused carpenters to
make houses and lodgings of great timber, which were couered with r&eacute;ed &amp; broome, so
manie and in such order, that it s&eacute;emed a new towne, and in it was a market place appointed
of purpose, in the which the market was dailie kept of vittels, &amp; all other

<p>Salutations premised. We giue you to vnderstand, that our souereigne lord the
king came to the towne of Poissie the daie before the Assumption of our ladie, where was
a certeine bridge ouer the water of Saine broken downe by the enimie, but the king
tarried there so long, till that the bridge was made againe. And whiles the bridge was in
reparing, there came a great number of men at armes, and other souldiers well armed, to
hinder the same. But the earle of Northampton issued out against them, and slue of them
more than a thousand, the rest fled awaie: thankes be to God. And at another time, our
men passed the water (although with much trauell) and slue a great number of the common
souldiers of France, about the citie of Paris, and countrie adioining, being part of
the French kings armie, and throughlie well appointed: so that our people haue now
made other good bridges vpon our enimies, God be thanked, without anie losse and
damage to vs. And on the morrow after the Assumption of our ladie, the king passed
the water of Saine, and marched toward Poissie, which is a towne of great defense, and
stronglie walled, and a maruellous strong castell within the same, which our enemies kept.
And when our vauntgard was passed the towne, our rergard gaue an assault therevnto,
and tooke the same, where were slaine more than thr&eacute;e hundred men at arms of our
enimies part. And the next daie following, the earle of Suffolke, and sir Hugh Spenser,
marched foorth vpon the commons of the countrie assembled and well armed, and in fine
discomfited them, and slue of them more than two hundred, &amp; tooke thr&eacute;e score gentlemen
prisoners, beside others.</p>

<p>And after that, the king marched toward grand Villiers, and while he was there incamped,
the kings vantgard was descried by the men at armes of the K. of Boheme:
whervpon our men issued out in great hast and ioined battell with them, but were
inforced to retire. Notwithstanding, thanks be vnto God, the earle of Northampton
issued out, and rescued the horssemen with the other soldiers: so that few or none of
them were either taken or slaine, sauing onlie Thomas Talbot, but had againe the enimie
in chase within two leagues of Amiens: of whome we tooke eight, and slue twelue of
their best men at armes: the rest being well horssed, tooke the towne of Amiens. After
this the king of England marched toward Pountife, vpon Bartholomew day, and came to
the water of Some, where the French king had laid fiue hundred men at armes, and thr&eacute;e
thousand footmen, purposing to haue kept and stopped our passage: but thanks be to
God, the K. of England and his host entered the same water of Some, where neuer man
passed before, without losse of any of our men; and after that incountered with the
enimie, and slue of them more than 2000, the rest fled to Abuile, in which chase were
taken manie knights, esquiers, &amp; men at armes. The same day sir Hugh Spenser tooke
the towne of Crotaie, where he &amp; his soldiers slue 400 men at armes, &amp; kept the towne,
where they found great store of vittels.</p>

<p>The same night incamped the king of England in the forrest of Cressie vpon the same
water, for that the French kings host came on the other side of the towne, n&eacute;ere vnto our
passage: but he would not take the water of vs, &amp; so marched toward Abuile. And
vpon the fridaie next following, the king being still incamped in the said forrest, our
scuriers descried the French K. which marched toward vs in foure great battels; and
hauing then vnderstanding of our enimies (as Gods will was) a little before the euening
tide, we drew to the plaine field, and set our battels in arraie: and immediatlie the fight
began, which was sore and cruel, &amp; indured long, for our enimies behaued themselues
right noblie. But thanks be giuen vnto God, the victorie fell on our side, &amp; the king our
aduersarie was discomfited with all his host &amp; put to flight: where also was slaine the king
of Boheme, the duke of Loraine, the earle of Alanson, the earle of Flanders, the earle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
Blois, the earle of Harecourt, with his two sons, the earle Daumarle, the earle de
Neuers, and his brother the lord of Tronard, the archbishop of Nismes, the archbishop of
Sens, the high prior of France, the earle of Sauoie, the lord of Morles, the lord de Guies,
le seigneur de Saint Nouant, le seigneur de Rosinburgh, with six earles of Almaine, and
diuerse other earles, barons, knights, and esquiers, whose names are vnknowne. And
Philip de Valois himselfe, with an other marques, which was called lord elector among
the Romans, escaped from the battell. The number of the men of armes which were
found dead in the field, beside the common soldiers and footmen, were a thousand, fiue
hundred, fortie and two: and all that night the king of England with his host aboad
armed in the field, where the battel was fought.</p>

<p>On the next morrow before the sunne rose, there marched towards vs another great host
mightie &amp; strong, of the Frenchmen: but the earle of Northampton, and the earle of
Norffolke issued out against them in thr&eacute;e battels, &amp; after long and terrible fight, them
likewise they discomfited by Gods great helpe and grace (for otherwise it could neuer haue
b&eacute;ene) where they tooke of knights and esquiers a great number, and slue aboue two
thousand, pursuing the chase thr&eacute;e leages from the place where the battell was fought.
The same night also the king incamped himselfe againe in the forrest of Cressie, and on
the morrow marched toward Bullongne, and by the way he tooke the towne of Staples:
and from thence he marched toward Calis, where he intendeth to plant his siege, and laie
his batterie to the same. And therfore our souereigne lord the king willeth and commandeth
you, in all that euer you may, to send to the said siege vittels conuenient. For
after the time of our departing from Caen, we haue trauelled through the countrie with
great perill &amp; danger of our people, but yet alwaies had of vittels plentie, thanks be to
God therefore. But now (as the case standeth) we partlie n&eacute;ed your helpe to be refreshed
with vittels. Thus fare you well. Written at the siege before the towne of Calis, the

that (as ye haue heard) the English campe was furnished with sufficient prouision of meat,

soldiers made roads and forrais into the borders of France next adioining, as towards
Guines, and saint Omer, ye euen to the gates of that towne, and sometime to Bullongne.
Also the earle of Northampton fetched a bootie out of Arthois, and as he returned toward
the host, he came to Terrouan, which towne the bishop had fortified and manned, deliuering
the custodie therof vnto sir Arnold Dandrehen: for when he heard the Englishmen
approched, he durst not tarrie within the citie himselfe, but got him to saint Omers. Sir
Arnold stood valiantlie to his defense, and would not y&eacute;eld, till by verie force the Englishmen
entered the citie, slue the soldiers, and tooke their capteine the said sir Arnold prisoner.
The citie was put to sacke, and after set on fire. And when the Englishmen
were departed, there came a number of Flemings from the siege, which they had laid before
S. Omers, and began a new spoile, and fired such houses belonging to the canons and
other, which the Englishmen had spared. Thus were those confines in most miserable
case, for no house nor other thing was in safegard, but such as were conteined within
closure of strong townes and fortresses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns won by the earle of Derbie.</div>

<p>The French king meaning to raise the siege from Calis, which the king of England kept
there, sent for his sonne the duke of Normandie, which had line long at the siege of
Aiguillon, and now by commandement of his father left it sore against his will. In this
mean while, the earle of Derbie remained in the citie of Burdeaux, and there had held him
during all the time that the siege laie before Aiguillon. When he once vnderstood that
the siege was raised, and that the duke of Normandie had broken vp his campe, he sent
into Gascoigne for all knights and esquires that held of the English part. Then came to
Burdeaux the lord Dalbret, the lord de Lespare, the lord de Rosam, the lord of Musident,
the lord of Pumiers, and a great sort more of the lords and nobles of Gascoigne, so that
the earle had twelue hundred men of armes, two thousand archers, and thr&eacute;e thousand
other footmen. They passed the riuer of Garon, betwixt Burdeaux and Blaie, and tooke
their waie to Zanctonge, so to go vnto Poictiers, and tooke by the waie the towne of Mirabell
by assault: they wan also the towne and castell of Aunaie, Surgieres, and Benon.
Also they took Maraunt in Poictow by force, they burnt also the towne of Lusignen, but
the castell they could not win. Moreouer, they did win the bridge, towne, and castell of
Tailburge, and slue all that were found within it, bicause a knight of the English part was
slaine in the assaulting. From thence the earle of Derbie went and laid siege to saint
Iohn Dangelie, which was y&eacute;elded to him by composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The citie of Poictiers woon by force.</div>

<p>At Niort he made thr&eacute;e assaults, but could not win it, and so from thence he came to
Bourge saint Mariment, the which was woone by force, and all that were within it slaine;
and in like manner the towne of Montreuill Bonin was woone, and the most part of them
within slaine, that tooke vpon them to defend it, which were 200 coiners of monie that
wrought in the mint, which the French king kept there. From thence he passed forward
with his host, and finallie came before the citie of Poictiers, which was great and large, so
that he could not besiege it but on the one side. The third daie after his comming thither,
he caused the citie to be assaulted in thr&eacute;e places, and the greatest number were appointed
to assaile the weakest part of the citie. As then there were no expert men of warre
within Poictiers, but a great multitude of people vnskilfull and not vsed to any feats of
warre, by reason whereof the Englishmen entered in at the weakest place. When they
within sawe the citie woone, they fled out at other gates, but yet there were slaine to the
number of seauen hundred persons, for all that came in the Englishmens waie, were put to
the sword, men, women, and children. The citie was sacked and rifled, so that great store
of riches was gotten there, as well of the inhabitants as other that had brought their goods
thither for safegard of the same. The earle of Derbie laie there ten or twelue daies, and
longer might haue laine, if his pleasure had so b&eacute;ene, for there was none that durst go about

<p>At his departure from Poictiers he left the citie void, for it was too great to be kept:
his souldiers and men of warre were so pestered with riches, that they wist not what to doo
therewith: they est&eacute;emed nothing but gold and siluer, and feathers for men of warre.
The earle visited by the waie as he returned homewards to Burdeaux the towne of saint

hauing furnished them with men, munition, and vittels necessarie, at his comming to Burdeaux
he brake vp his host, and licencing his people to depart, thanked them for their
paines and good seruice. All this while the siege continued still before Calis, and the
French king amongst other deuises which he imagined how to raise the K. of England from
it, procured the Scots to make warre into England, insomuch that Dauid king of Scotland,
notwithstanding the truce which yet indured betwixt him and the king of England, vpon
hope now to doo some great exploit, by reason of the absence of king Edward, intangled
thus with the besieging of Calis, he assembled the whole puissance of his realme, to the

hope of spoile to send foorth his light horssemen to harrie the countrie on ech side him,

thousand other, with the Welshmen, and issuing out of the towne, they found the Scots
readie to come forward to incounter them. Then euerie man was set in order of battell,
and there were foure battels ordeined, one to aid another. The first was led by the
bishop of Durham, Gilbert de Vinfreuile earle of Anegos, Henrie lord Percie, and the lord
Henrie Scroope: the second by the archbishop of Yorke, and the lord Rafe Neuill: the
third by the bishop of Lincolne, Iohn lord Mowbraie, and the lord Thomas de Rokebie:

Scots had sharpe and heauie axes, &amp; gaue with the same great and mightie strokes, howbeit
finallie the Englishmen by the helpe of God obteined the victorie, although they lost
manie of their men. There were diuerse of the nobles of Scotland slaine, to the number
of seauen earles, beside lords. The king was taken in the field sore wounded, for he
fought valiantlie. He was prisoner to an esquier of Northumberland, who as soone as he
had taken him, rode out of the field with him, accompanied onelie with eight of his seruants,
and rested not till he came to his owne castell where he dwelled, being thirtie miles

<p>In this meane while, king Philip hauing dailie word how the power of his enimie king

and that his men within Calis were brought to such an extreme point, that without sp&eacute;edie

hands of his said enimie, to the great preiudice of all the realme of France, after great
deliberation taken vpon this so weightie a matter, he commanded euerie man to m&eacute;et
him in their best arraie for the warre, at the feast of Pentecost in the citie of Amiens, or
in those marches. At the daie and place thus appointed, there came to him Odes duke
of Burgoigne, and the duke of Normandie eldest sonne to the king, the duke of Orleance

<p>These noble men being thus assembled, they tooke councell which waie they might
passe to giue battell to the Englishmen: it was thought the best waie had b&eacute;ene through
Flanders, but the Flemings in fauour of the king of England denied, not onelie to open
their passages to the Frenchmen, but also had leuied an armie of an hundred thousand
men of one and other, and laid siege to Aire, and burnt the countrie all about. Wherevpon
there were manie sharpe bickerings and sore incounters betwixt the Flemings and
such Frenchmen as king Philip sent foorth against them both, now, whilest the French
armie laie about Amiens, and also before, during all the time that the siege lay at Calis.
For all the French towns vpon the frontiers were stuffed with strong garrisons of souldiers,
as Lisle, saint Omers, Arras, Bullongne, Aire and Monttreuill, and those men of
war were euer readie vpon occasion to attempt sundrie exploits. After this, when the
armie of the Flemings was broken vp, and returned home, or rather diuided into parts,
and lodged along on the frontiers, the French king with two thousand men one and
other came forward, taking his way through the countrie called la Belme, and so
by the countrie of Frankeberge, came streight to the hill of Sangate, betwixt Calis and
Wisant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Derbie.</div>

<p>The king of England had caused a strong castell to be made betw&eacute;ene the towne of
Calis and the sea, to close vp that passage, and had placed therein thr&eacute;e score men
of armes, and two hundred archers which kept the hauen in such sort that nothing could
come in nor out. Also considering that his enimies could come neither to succour the
towne, nor to annoie his host, except either by the downes alongst the sea side, or else
aboue by the high waie, he caused all his nauie to drawe alongst by the coast of the
downes, to stop vp that the Frenchmen should not approch that waie. Also the erle of
Derbie being come thither out of Guien, was appointed to k&eacute;epe Newland bridge, with
a great number of men of armes and archers, so that the Frenchmen could not approch
anie waie, vnlesse they would haue come through the marishes, which to doo was not
possible.</p>

notwithstanding, when the marshals of France had well viewed all the passages and
streicts through the which their armie must passe, if they meant to fight with the Englishmen,
they well perceiued that they could not come to the Englishmen to giue them battell,
without the king would lose his people, wherevpon (as Froissard saith) the French king
sent the lord Geffrey de Charnie, the lord Eustace de Ribaumont, Guie de N&eacute;ele, and
the lord de Beauiew vnto the king of England, which required him on their maisters behalfe
to appoint certeine of his councell, as he would likewise appoint certeine of his,
which by common consent might aduise betw&eacute;ene them an indifferent place for them to
trie the battell vpon: wherevnto the king of England answered, "That there he was and
had b&eacute;ene almost a whole yeare, which could not be vnknowne to his aduersarie their
maister, so that he might haue come sooner if he would: but now, sith he had suffered
him there to remaine so long, without offer of battell, he meant not to accomplish his
desire, nor to depart from that, which to his great cost he had brought now at length to
that point, that he might easilie win it. Wherefore if the French K. nor his host could
not passe those waies which were closed by the English power, let them s&eacute;eke some other

<p>In this meane while came two cardinals fr&#x014D; pope Clement, to treat a peace betwixt the
two kings, wherevpon commissioners were appointed, as the dukes of Burgoigne and
Burbone, the lord Lewes de Sauoie, and the lord Iohn de Heinault, otherwise called lord
Beaumont, on the French part: and the earles of Derbie and Northampton, the lord
Reginald Cobham, and the lord Walter de Mannie, on the English part. These commissioners

daies togither, but agr&eacute;ed not vpon anie conclusion, and so the cardinals departed; and
the French king perceiuing he could not haue his purpose, brake vp his host and returned
to France, bidding Calis farewell. After that the French king with his host was once
departed from Sangate, without ministring anie succour to them within the towne, they
began to sue for a parl&eacute;e, which being granted, in the end they were contented to y&eacute;eld,
and the king granted to receiue them and the towne on these conditions; that six of the
ch&eacute;efe burgesses of the towne should come foorth bareheaded, barefooted, and bareleg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>ged,

<p>This determinate resolution of king Edward being intimated to the commons of the

that no other grace would be obteined, six of the most wealthie burgesses of all the towne
agr&eacute;ed to hazard their liues for the safegard of the residue, and so according to the prescript
order deuised by the K. they went foorth of the gates, and were presented by the
lord Walter de Mannie to the king, before whom they kn&eacute;eled downe, offered to him the
keies of the towne, and besought him to haue mercie vpon them. But the king regarding
them with a fell countenance, commanded streight that their heads should be striken
off. And although manie of the noble men did make great intreatance for them, yet
would no grace be shewed, vntill the qu&eacute;ene being great with child, came and kn&eacute;eled
downe before the king hir husband, and with lamentable ch&eacute;ere &amp; w&eacute;eping eies intreated

other capteins and men of name were staied as prisoners, and the common soldiers and
other meane people of the towne were licenced to depart and void their houses, leauing
all their armor and riches behind them. The king would not haue any of the old inhabitants
to remaine in the towne, saue onlie a priest, and two other ancient personages,
such as best knew the customes, lawes and ordinances of the towne. He appointed to
send ouer thither amongst other Englishmen, there to inhabit, 36 burgesses of London,
and those of the wealthiest sort, for he meant to people the towne onelie with Englishmen,

<p>The cardinals, of whome ye heard before, being come as legats from pope Clement
to mooue communication of peace, did so much in the matter, that a truce was granted
betwixt the realme of England &amp; France, for the terme of twelue moneths, or two yeares
(as Froissard saith.) But the English chronicle and Iacobus Meir s&eacute;eme to agr&eacute;e, that
this truce was taken but for nine moneths, though afterwards the same was proroged.
To the which truce all parties agr&eacute;ed, Britaine excepted, for the two women there would
not be quieted, but still pursued the war the one against the other. After that this truce
was accorded, the king with the qu&eacute;ene his wife returned into England, and left as capteine
within Calis one sir Amerie of Pauie an Italian knight, or (as other bookes haue)
he was but capteine of the castell, or of some one of the towers of that towne, which
s&eacute;emeth more like to be true, than that the king should commit the whole charge of the
towne vnto his gouernement, being a stranger borne, and therefore Iacobus Meir is the
more to be credited, that writeth how sir Amerie of Pauie was left but in charge with the
castell onelie, and that the towne was committed to the k&eacute;eping of the lord Iohn Beauchampe,
and Lewes his brother.</p>

<p>But now that there was a peace thus concluded betwixt the two kings, it s&eacute;emed to the
English people that the sunne breake foorth after a long cloudie season, by reason both
of the great plentie of althings, and remembrance of the late glorious victories: for there
were few women that were housek&eacute;epers within this land, but they had some furniture of
houshold that had b&eacute;ene brought to them out of France as part of the spoile got in
Caen, Calis, Carenten, or some other good towne. And beside houshold stuffe, the
English maides and matrones were bedecked and trimmed vp in French womens iewels
and apparell, so that as the French women lamented for the losse of those things, so our
women reioised of the gaine. In this 22 yeare, from Midsummer to Christmasse for the
more part it continuallie rained, so that there was not one day and night drie togither,
by reason whereof great flouds insued, and the ground therewith was sore corrupted, and
manie inconueniences insued, as great sickenes, and other, in somuch that in the yeare
following in France the people died woonderfullie in diuerse places. In Italie also, and
in manie other countries, as well in the lands of the infidels, as in christendome, this
grieuous mortalitie reigned to the great destruction of people. &para; About the end of
August, the like death began in diuerse places of England, and especiallie in London,
continuing so for the space of twelue moneths following. And vpon that insued great
barrennesse, as well of the sea, as the land, neither of them y&eacute;elding such plentie of
things as before they had doone. Whervpon vittels and corne became scant and hard to
come by.</p>

<p>About the same time died Iohn Stretford archbishop of Canturburie, after whome succ&eacute;eded

Thomas Bredwardin, who deceassed within one yeare after his consecration, so that then
Simon Islep was consecrated archbishop by pope Clement the sixt, being the 53 archbishop
that had sit in that seat. Within a while after, William archbishop of Yorke died: in
whose place succ&eacute;eded Iohn Torsbie, being the 44 archbishop that had gouerned that
church. Moreouer in this 23 yeare of king Edwards reigne, the great mortalitie in England
still continuing, there was a practise in hand for recouering againe of Calis to the
French kings possession. The lord Geffrie of Charnie lieng in the towne of S. Omers,
did practise with sir Amerie de Pauie, to be receiued into the towne of Calis by the castell,
secretlie in the night season. The Italian gaue eare to the lord Geffrie his sute; and to
make few words, couenanted for the summe of twentie thousand crownes to betraie the
towne vnto him, in such sort as he could best deuise.</p>

<p>&para; Here writers varie: for Froissard saith that king Edward had information thereof,

also other writers affirme, that the Italian aduertised the king of all the drift and matter
betwixt him &amp; the lord Geffrie of Charnie, before he went through with the bargaine. But
whether by him or by other, truth it is the king was made priuie to the matter at Hauering
Bower in Essex (where he kept the feast of Christmasse) &amp; therevpon departing from
thence, he came to Douer, and the daie before the night of the appointment made for the
deliuerie of the castell of Calis (hauing secretlie made his prouision) he tooke shipping, and
landed the same night at Calis, in so secret maner, that but few of the towne vnderstood of
his arriuall, he brought with him out of England thr&eacute;e hundred men of armes, and six
hundred archers, whom he laid in chambers and towers within the castell, so closelie that
few or none perceiued it, the maner he knew by sir Amerie de Pauie his aduertisements
(accordinglie as it was agr&eacute;ed betwixt them) that the lord Geffrie of Charnie was appointed
to come and enter the towne that night, for the king had commanded sir Amerie to
proc&eacute;ed in merchandizing with the said lord Charnie, and onelie to make him priuie of the
day &amp; houre in the which the feat should be wrought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king crieth Mannie to the rescue.</div>

<p>The lord Geffrie de Charnie being couenanted that he should be receiued into Calis
the first night of the new yeare, departed from S. Omers, where he had assembled fiue
hundred speares, the last day of December toward night, and so in secret wise he passed
foorth, till about the middest of the next night after, he approched n&eacute;ere to Calis, and
sending an hundred men of armes to take possession of the castell, and to paie the Italian
his twentie thousand crownes, came to the posterne of the castell, where sir Amerie de
Pauie hauing let downe the posterne bridge, was readie to bring them in by the same
posterne, and so the hundred men of armes entered, and sir Edward de Rentie deliuered
to the Italian his twentie thousand crownes in a bag, who when he had cast the crownes
into a coffer (for he had no leisure to tell them) he brought the Frenchmen into the
dungeon of the castell, as it were to possesse them of the ch&eacute;efest strength of the fortresse.
Within this dungeon or tower was the king of England closelie laid, with two hundred men
of armes, who issued out with their swords and axes in their hands, crieng Mannie to the
rescue, for the king had so ordeined, that both he and his sonne should fight vnder the
banner of the lord Walter de Mannie, as ch&eacute;efe of that enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earles of Stafford and Suffolke, the lords Montacute, Berkley and la Ware.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Frenchmen alight on foot.</div>

<p>Then were the Frenchmen greatlie abashed, in such wise, that perceiuing how no defense
might aduance them, they y&eacute;elded themselues without any great shew of resistance. Herewith
the Englishmen issued out of the castell into the towne, and mounted on horssebacke,
for they had the French prisoners horsses, and then the archers road to Bullongne gate,
where the lord Geffrie was with his banner before him of gules thr&eacute;e scutchens siluer.
He had great desire to be the first that should enter the towne: but shortlie the king of
England with the prince his son was readie at the gate, vnder the banner of the lord
Walter de Mannie to assaile him. There were also other banners, as the earles of Stafford
and Suffolke, the lord Iohn Montacute brother to the earle of Salisburie, the lord Beauchampe,
the lord Berkley, and the lord de la Ware. Then the great gate was set open,
and they all issued foorth crieng Mannie to the rescue. The Frenchmen perceiuing that
they were betraied, alighted from their horsses, and put themselues in order of battell on
foot, determining to fight it out like valiant men of war. The king perceiuing this, caused
his people likewise to be set in order of battell, &amp; sent thr&eacute;e hundred archers to Newland
bridge, to distresse those Frenchmen, which he heard should be there. This was earelie in
the morning but incontinentlie it was daie: the Frenchmen kept their ground a while, and
manie feats of armes were doone of both parts, but the Englishmen euer increased out of
Calis, and the Frenchmen diminished, so that finallie they were ouercome, as well in the

<div class="sidenote">Sir Eustace de Ribaumont.</div>

<p>It chanced that in the hotest of the fight, the king was matched with sir Eustace de
Ribaumont, a right strong and hardie knight. There was a sore incounter betwixt him
and the king, that maruell it was to behold them. At length they were put asunder, for a
great companie of both parts came that waie, and there fought fiercelie togither. The
Frenchmen did behaue themselues right valiantlie, and especiallie sir Eustace de Ribaumont:
he strake the king that daie twise vpon his kn&eacute;es, but finallie he was taken prisoner
by the king himselfe. The lord Geffrie of Charnie was also taken prisoner, and wounded
right sore, but the king of his noble courtesie caused him to be dressed by surgions, and
tenderlie looked vnto. There were slaine, sir Henrie de Blois, and sir Pepin de la Ware,
with other, to the number of six hundred. Monsieur de Memorancie escaped with great
danger. Froissard saieth, that this battell was fought in the yeare 1348, vpon the last of
December, towards the next morning being Newyeares daie: but (as Auesburie &amp; Walsingham
haue, who begin the yeare at our ladie day) this enterprise chanced 1349, and so

weare on his owne head, in token that he had best deserued it for his manfull prowes shewed
in the fight; &amp; beside that in fauour of his tried valiancie, he acquit him of his ransome,

<p>About the end of August the death in London ceassed, which had bin so great &amp; vehement
within that citie, that ouer &amp; beside the bodies buried in other accustomed burieng
places (which for their infinit number cannot be reduced into account) there were buried
that yeare dailie, from Candlemasse till Easter, in the Charterhouse yard of London, more
than two hundred dead corpses. Also this yeare, by the earnest sute of the two cardinals
which were sent (as ye haue heard) from pope Clement the sixt, a peace was concluded
for one yeare. There met n&eacute;ere vnto Calis for the treatie of this peace, the foresaid two
cardinals, as mediators; and for the king of England, the bishop of Norwich treasuror
and high chancellor of the realme, with others came thither as commissioners; and in
like maner for the French king, there appeared the bishop of Lion, and the abbat of S.
Denise. &para; This yeare in August died Philip de Valois the French king. Here is to be
noted, that all those that were borne, after the beginning of that great mortalitie whereof
ye haue heard, wanted foure ch&eacute;eke t&eacute;eth (when they came to the time of growth) of
those 32 which the people before that time commonlie vsed to haue, so that they had but
28. In this 24 yeare of this kings reigne, there was a combat fought in lists within the
kings palace of Westminster, betwixt the lord Iohn, bastard sonne to Philip king of
France, &amp; a knight of the towne of Ypres in Flanders; but the bastard had the vpper
hand, and vanquished his aduersarie. &para; About the feast of the decollation of saint Iohn
Baptist, king Edward aduertised of a fl&eacute;et of Spaniards returning foorth of Flanders, that
was laden with clothes and other riches, assembled a conuenient power of men of armes
and archers, &amp; at Sandwich tooke the sea with them, sailing foorth, till vpon the coast of
Winchelsie he met with the Spaniards, and there assailed them; so that betwixt him and
those Spaniards, there was a sore fight, and long continued, to the great losse of people on
both parts; but in the end, the bright beame of victorie shone vpon the English sailes, so
that all the Spaniards were slaine, for they were so proud and obstinat (as Walsingham
affirmeth) that they would not y&eacute;eld, but rather choose to die, &amp; so they did ind&eacute;ed, either
on the Englishmens weapons points, or else were they drowned there in the sea, six and
twentie of their ships were taken, in the which was found great store of good ware and
riches. And so the king thought himselfe well reuenged of the Spaniards, which in the
last yeare about Alhallontide, had entred into the riuer of Garons, as it runneth vp towards
Burdeaux, and there finding manie ships fraught with wines, slue all the Englishmen they
found aboord, and tooke awaie the ships with them: which iniurie mooued the king to
enterprise this exploit now at this time against them.</p>

with sir Thomas Dagworth, and there slue the same sir Thomas, and to the number of one
hundred men of armes with him. There were sent solemne messengers this yeare vnto
Auignion, for the establishing of a peace, mentioned betwixt the king of England and

<p>In the fiue and twentith yeare of king Edwards reigne, the Frenchmen hauing laid siege
vnto the towne of saint Iohn Dangeli, the lord Dalbrets son, hauing assembled six hundred
men of armes, Gascoigns and Englishmen, meant to worke some feat for reliefe of them
within, whervpon, as he was marching through the countrie of Xainctonge n&eacute;ere vnto
Xaincts the eighth of Aprill, or (as other haue) the first, he was incountered by the lord
Guie de N&eacute;ell, one of the marshals of France, &amp; other French lords, where at length, the
Frenchmen were discomfited, manie also slaine, and diuerse taken prisoners, of which
number was the said marshall, with his brother the lord William, and sir Arnold de Dan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>drehen,
beside others, to the number of 300 men of armes, but yet the siege remained, till

<p>The same yeare in October, an English archer of the garison of Calis, named Iohn of
Dancaster, by licence of the lord deputie of Calis, tooke with him thr&eacute;escore persons men
of armes and archers, and in the night that goeth before the feast daie of S. Vincent, in the
last quarter of the same night, he comming to the castell of Guines, found as well the
watch as others fast asl&eacute;epe, wherevpon he passed a water that adioined to the castell,
wading vp to the girdle, and so came to the wall, where he &amp; his companie rearing vp
ladders, mounted by the same so secretlie, that slaieng the watch, being not past thr&eacute;e or
foure persons that were on the wals, they entred the castell, and finding the Frenchmen
asl&eacute;epe, slue those that vpon their wakening made any defense, and tooke the residue,
whome they suffered to depart: and by this meanes they wan the castell, finding great
store of vittels within, and so as they found it, they kept it to the king of Englands vse.
The French histories declare, that one Guilliam de Beauconroy that was capteine of this
castell, betraied the place to the Englishmen, for a summe of monie, and when the French
king required restitution bicause the truce was not yet expired, he was shifted off with this
forged answer, that nothing was excepted by the assurance of the truce, concerning things
that should be bought and sold. The Frenchman that betraied it, was shortlie after put to
execution at Amiens.</p>

Bicause these new p&eacute;eces wanted of the weight of the old sterling coine, the prices

more craftie than before time they had b&eacute;ene, demanded great wages. &para; This yeare, vpon

<div class="sidenote">Weares and milles.</div>

<p>In the seuen and twentith yeare of his reigne, K. Edward held a parlement at Westminster,
after the feast of Easter, in which an ordinance was deuised, what wages seruants
and laborers should be allowed, prohibiting them to receiue aboue the rate which they were
accustomed to take before the yeare of the great mortalitie. Seruants and laborers were
in d&eacute;ed growen to be more subtill than before time they had b&eacute;ene; but by reason of the
prices of things were inhanced, it is like they demanded greater wages than they had doone
before time: and one cause of the dearth was imputed to the new coine of monie, being of
lesse weight in the value thereof, than before it had b&eacute;ene, so that the bishop of Winchester
being lord treasuror, who had counselled the king to ordeine those grotes and halfe grotes,
was euill spoken of amongst the people. In this parlement there were statutes also made,
that clothes should in length and in breadth through the realme, beare the same assise, as
was ordeined in the parlement holden at Northampton. Also, that all weares, milles, and
other lets, should be remooued foorth of riuers, that might be any hinderance of ships,
boats, or lighters to passe vp and downe the same. But these good ordinances tooke little
or none effect, by reason of bribes that walked abroad, and fr&eacute;endship of lords and great
men, that sought rather their owne commoditie, than the common-wealths.</p>

deliuerance of the lord Charles de Blois, but also for the matching of his eldest sonne in

matter was so far forwards, that in the yeare last passed, the said lord Charles, leauing
two of his sonnes and a daughter in pledge for the paiement of fortie thousand florens,
agr&eacute;ed vpon for his ransome; he was permitted to returne into Britaine to prouide that
monie: and withall, to procure a dispensation, that his eldest sonne might marrie with
one of K. Edwards daughters, notwithstanding that otherwise they were within the degr&eacute;es
of consanguinitie, prohibiting them to marrie. Herevpon this yeare about Michaelmas,
he returned into England with the same dispensation: but bicause about the
same time the Britains had taken by stealth an Iland with a castell therein, that the Englishmen
had kept, &amp; put all those which they found therein, to the sword, the said lord
Charles, otherwise duke of Britaine, lost the kings fauour, so that he would heare no

the French king caused them to staie, and taking on him the matter, made them fr&eacute;ends,

staple of wools from the townes in Flanders, and caused the same to be kept at Westminster,
Chichester, Lincolne, Bristowe, Canturburie and Hull. This was doone in despite

<p>Sir Walter Bentlie, vpon his comming ouer foorth of Britaine, where he had b&eacute;ene the

till the latter end of Iulie, by reason whereof, manie inconueniencies insued: and one

<p>In the eight and twentith yeare of king Edwards reigne, vpon a treatie that was holden

were in maner fullie agr&eacute;ed vpon a peace, so that nothing wanted, but putting vnto their

all the lands of his dutchie of Aquitaine, without holding the same of anie by homage,
or resort, and in consideration thereof he should resigne all his claime to the crowne of
France. H&eacute;erevpon were ambassadors sent from either king, vnto the pope, and a truce
taken, to indure till the feast of saint Iohn Baptist in the yeare next following. Ambassadors
for the king of England were these: Henrie duke of Lancaster, Iohn earle of
Arundell, the bishops of Norwich and London, and the lord Guie de Brian. For the
French king, the archbishop of Rouen lord chancellor of France, the duke of Burbon,
and others: but when the matter came to be heard before the pope about Christmasse,
all went to smoke that had b&eacute;ene talked of: for the Frenchmen denied that the articles
were drawne according to the meaning of their commissioners, and the pope also winked
at the matter, so that the English ambassadors (when they saw that nothing would be

<p>This yeare, the tenth of Februarie, there rose a sore debate betwixt the scholers and

one that sold wine: for the scholer perceiuing himselfe euill vsed, powred the wine on
the drawers head, knocking the pot about his pate, so as the bloud ranne downe by his
eares. H&eacute;erevpon began a sore fraie betwixt the scholers and townesmen, which continued
for the most part of two daies togither. There were twentie townesmen slaine,
beside those that were hurt: but at length, there came a great number of countrimen
foorth of the villages next adioining, to aid the townesmen, entring the towne with a
blacke banner, and so fiercelie assailed the scholers, that they were constreined to fl&eacute;e to
their houses and hostels, but their enimies pursuing them, brake vp their doores, entered
their chambers, slue diuerse of them, and threw them into priuies, tare their bookes,
and bare awaie their goods. The sholers h&eacute;erewith tooke such displeasure, that they
departed the Vniuersitie: those of Merton colledge, and other the like colledges onelie

<p>The bishop of Lincolne inhibited pr&eacute;ests to celebrate diuine seruice in presence of anie
laie man within that towne of Oxenford; and the king sending his iustices thither, to
take knowledge of this disorderlie riot, there were diuerse, both of the townesmen and
scholers indited, and certeine of the burgesses committed to ward. &para; This yeare, the

(named Thomas) held at the fontstone: he was borne the seauenth of Ianuarie last
past. In the parlement holden at Westminster this yeare after Easter, the king tooke
vpon him to make an end of the quarrell betwixt the scholers and townesmen of Oxenford,
and sauing to euerie man his right, pardoned the scholers of all transgressions:
and this he signified into euerie shire, by writs directed to the shiriffes, they to proclame
the same for more notice of the thing. And so in the summer following, the Vniuersitie
began againe to flourish, students resorting thither from each side, and falling afresh to
their academicall exercises, which they n&eacute;eded not to haue discontinued, if either partie,
I meane the townesmen or scholers, would haue tolerated and borne one with another,
and not so rashlie haue vndertaken the reuenge of one anothers wrath and iniurie; but,</p>

<p>In this parlement, the processe of the iudgement had and made against Roger Mortimer,
late earle of March, was reuoked, adnihilated, and made void, so that the lord
Roger Mortimer was restored to the title and possessions of the earledome of March, as
cousine and heire to his grandfather the said erle of March. Moreouer, to this parlement
came the bishop of Carpentras, and the abbat of Clugnie, being sent from pope
Innocent the sixt, to make sute to haue the truce proroged betwixt the two kings, of
England and France, to whome the king himselfe in person, made this resolute answer,
that he would not agr&eacute;e to anie longer truce; for that, when diuerse times, at the
Frenchmens sute, he had consented to haue truce by mediation of two cardinals, sent
to him about the same matter, his aduersaries in the meane time, whilest such truces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>dured,
had doone much harme and damage by subtill practises to persons and places
beyond the sea, that were vnder his rule and gouernement, yet he said he would deliberate
h&eacute;ereof with his councell, and after intimate his pleasure to the pope, and to them
of France by messengers which he would send ouer for that purpose: and so these ambassadors
within foure daies after their comming, were thus dispatched with answer.
Herewith in this parlement it was ordeined, that the prince of Wales, being as then
about foure and twentie yeares of age, should passe ouer into Gascoigne, and have

said ships had principall streamers of the duke of Lancasters armes, who was appointed
with a great power of chosen men of armes and archers to passe to the sea with the same
ships, but few or none of his companie knew whither; horsses they had none. He had
with him two of the kings sonnes, Lionell of Antwerpe, and Iohn of Gant, the elder of
them being about sixt&eacute;ene yeares of age. Also, there went with him the earles of Northampton,
March, and Stafford, beside manie lords, barons, &amp; knights. On the tenth of
Iulie, he made saile to Gr&eacute;enewich, and there and at Sandwich he staied, till the Assumption
of our ladie, the wind for the most part continuing all that while at west and south,
contrarie to his iournie, as it might appeare. At length with much difficultie he came
to Winchelsie, &amp; after to the Wight. It was thought, that the dukes purpose was to
passe into Normandie, to ioine with the king of Nauarre, who was at variance with the
French king. But after it was knowen by espials that they were made fr&eacute;ends, the duke
of Lancaster doubting crooked measures, and hauing with him no horssemen, returned

Almaigne, so that he had about thr&eacute;e thousand men of armes and two thousand archers
on horsebacke, beside archers on foot a great number. The citie of London had sent to
him fiue hundred men of armes, and fiue hundred archers all in one sute or liuerie, at
their owne costs and charges. On the second of Nouember, he set from Calis, marching

credence, offering battell on tuesdaie next following vnto the king of England, in presence
of the duke of Lancaster, the earles of Northampton, and the lord Walter de Mannie,
who in the kings behalfe declared to the constable, that the king of England, to eschew
shedding of bloud, would fight with the French king bodie to bodie, so to trie their
right: and if he liked not of that match, then if he would choose thr&eacute;e or foure knights
to him that were n&eacute;erest to him in bloud, he should choose the like number. But when
this offer would not be accepted, the English lords offered battell the next day, being
fridaie, or else on saturdaie following, at the Frenchmens choice: but the constable of
France and his companie, continuing in their first offer, refused both those daies.
Then the English lords accepted the daie by them assigned, with condition, that if they
brought not king Edward to giue battell that day, they would y&eacute;eld themselues prisoners,
so that the Frenchmen would likewise vndertake for their king. The constable hauing
no answer readie, staied a while, and after flatlie refused to make any such couenant.
Finallie, when the English lords perceiued their aduersaries, not to meane battell, as their
words at the first pretended, they brake off, and both parties returned home. The king
of England staied till the tuesdaie, and paid the strangers their wages, and so came backe
into England. On the sixt of Nouember, whilest the king was thus abroad in Picardie,
the Scots verie earlie in the morning of that daie, came priuilie to Berwike, entred by
stealth into the towne, and sleaing thr&eacute;e or foure Englishmen, tooke it, with all the goods
and persons within it, those excepted, which got to the castell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The proc&eacute;edings of the prince of Wales in Aquitaine.</div>

<p>In a parlement summoned this yeare, the mondaie after the feast of saint Edmund the
king, the lords and commons granted to king Edward fiftie shillings of euerie sacke of
wooll, that should be caried ouer the sea, for the space of six yeares next insuing. By
this grant it was thought, that the king might dispend a thousand markes sterling a day,
such vent of wools had the English merchants in that season. &para; The parlement being
ended, the king about S. Andrews tide set forward towards Scotland, and held his Christmasse
at Newcastell. About which time by letters sent from the prince, the king was
aduertised of his proc&eacute;edings after his arriuall in Gascoigne, where being ioifullie receiued
of the nobles, and other the people of that countrie (as before y&eacute;e haue heard) he declared
to them the cause of his thither comming, and tooke aduise with them how to
proc&eacute;ed in his businesse; and so about the tenth of October, he set forward to passe
against his enimies, first entring into a countrie called Iuliake, which togither with the
fortresses y&eacute;elded to him, without anie great resistance. Then he rode through the countie
Armignac, wasting and spoiling the countrie, and so passed through the lands of the
vicounts de la Riuiere, and after entered into the countie de l'Estrac, and passing through
the same, came to the countie of Commiges, finding the towne of S. Matain void, being
a good towne &amp; one of the best in that countrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carcasson.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Narbonne. Two bishops sent from the pope to the prince of Wales.</div>

<p>After this, he passed by the land of the earle of Lisle, till he came within a league of
Tholouse, where the earle of Armignac, being the French kings lieutenant in those parts,
and other great lords and nobles were assembled. The prince with his armie tarried
there two daies, and after passed ouer the riuer of Garonne, and after ouer an other
riuer thereabouts, a league aboue Tholouse, lodging that night a league on the other side
of Tholouse: and so they passed thorough Tholouse, dailie taking townes &amp; castels,
wherein they found great riches, for the countrie was verie plentifull. Vpon Alhallowes
&eacute;euen, they came to castell Naudarie, and from thence they tooke the waie to Carcasson,
into the which a great number of men of armes and commons were withdrawne. But
vpon the approch of the Englishmen, they slipt awaie, and got them to a strong castell
that stood n&eacute;ere at hand. The third day after, the Englishmen burnt the towne, and passing
forth, trauersed all the countrie of Carcassonois, till they came to the towne of Narbonne.
The people there were fled into the castell, in which the vicount of Narbonne
was inclosed, with fiue hundred men of arms. The prince staied there two daies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
pope sent two bishops towards the prince, to treat with him of peace, but bicause the
prince would not hearken to anie treatie without commission from his father, they could
not get anie safe conduct to approch n&eacute;erer.</p>

<p>The prince hauing aduertisments h&eacute;ere, that his enimies were assembled, and followed
him, he turned backe to m&eacute;et them, but they had no will to abide him: for although the
earle of Armignac, the constable of France, the marshall Cleremont, and the prince of
Orange, with diuerse other n&eacute;ere to Tholouse, made some shew to impeach the prince his
passage, yet in the end they withdrew, not without some losse, for the lord Bartholomew
de Burwasch ali&agrave;s Burghersch, sir Iohn Chandois, the lord Iames Audeley, and sir
Thomas Felton, being sent foorth to view them, skirmished with two hundred of their
men of armes, and tooke of them fiue and thirtie. After this, they had no mind to abide
the English power, but still shranke awaie, as the prince was readie to follow them, and so
he perceiuing that the Frenchmen would not giue him battell, he withdrew towards Burdeaux,
after he had spent eight w&eacute;ekes in that his iournie, and so comming thither, he wintered
there, whilest his capteins in the meane time tooke diuerse townes and castels abroad
in the countrie. &para; And now to the end y&eacute;e may haue more plaine information of the
princes dooings in those parties, I haue thought good to make you partakers of a

<p>My lord, as touching the newes in these parts, may it please you to vnderstand, that
all the earles, barons, baronets, knights, and esquiers, were in helth at the making hereof,
and my lord hath not lost either knight or esquier in this voyage, except the lord Iohn
Lisle, who was slaine after a strange manner with a quarrell, the third day after we were
entered into our enimies countries, he died the fiftenth of October. And please it you
to vnderstand, that my lord hath ridden through the countrie of Arminac, and hath taken
many fensed townes and burnt and destroied them, except certeine which he hath fortified.
After this, he marched into the vicountie of Rouergne, where he tooke a good towne named
Pleasance, the chiefest towne of that countrie, which he hath burnt and destroied, with
the countrie round about the same. This doone, he went into the countie d'Astrike,
wherin he tooke manie townes, wasted and destroied all the countrie. After this, he
entred into the countie of Cominge, and tooke manie townes there, which he caused to
be destroied &amp; burnt, togither with all the countrie abroad. He tooke also the towne
of S. Matan, which is the ch&eacute;efest towne of that countrie, being as large in compasse
as Norwich.</p>

<p>Afterward, he entered into the countie of Lisle, and tooke the most part of the fensed
townes therin, causing diuerse of them to be burnt and destroied as he passed. And
after entring into the lordship of Tholouse, we passed the riuer of Girond, and an other
a league aboue Tholouse, which is verie great: for our enimies had burnt all the bridges,
as well on the one side of Tholouse, as the other, except the bridges with in Tholouse, for
the riuer runneth through the towne. And the constable of France, the marshall Cleremont,
and the earle of Arminac, were with a great power within the towne the same time.
And Tholouse is a great towne, strong, faire, and well walled, and there was none in our
host that knew the foord there: but yet by the grace and goodnesse of God we found
it. So then we marched through the seigniorie of Tholouse, &amp; tooke manie good townes
inclosed, and burnt and destroied them, and all the countrie about.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">He meaneth the Merantine sea.</div>

<p>Then we entred into the signiorie of Carcason, and we tooke manie good towns,
before we came to Carcason, which towne we also tooke, which is greater, stronger,
&amp; fairer than Yorke. And as well this towne as all other townes in the countrie
were burnt and destroied. And after we had passed by manie iournies through
the countrie of Carcason, we came into the seigniorie of Narbon, and we tooke
manie townes, and wasted them, till we came to Narbon, which towne was holden
against vs, but it was woone by force, and the said towne is little lesse than London,
and is situat vpon the Gr&eacute;ekish sea, for that the distance from the said towne
vnto the Gr&eacute;ekish sea is not past two leagues, and there is an hauen and a place to
arriue at, from whence the water c&#x014D;meth vp to Narbon. And Narbon is not but
eleuen leagues distant from Mountpellier, &amp; eight&eacute;ene from Eguemortz, &amp; thirtie from
Auignion. And may it please you to vnderstand, that the holie father sent his messengers
to my lord, that were not past seuen leagues fr&#x014D; him, and they sent a sergeant at
armes, that was sergeant at armes attendant on the doore of our holie fathers chamber,
with their letters to my lord, praieng him to haue a safe conduct to come to declare
to his highnesse their message from the holie father, which was to treat betwixt my
L. and his aduersaries of France: and the said sergeant was two daies in the host before
my lord would s&eacute;e him, or receiue his letters. And the reason was, bicause he had
vnderstanding, that the power of France was come foorth of Tholouse toward Carcason,
so that my lord was driuen to turne backe towards them suddenlie, and so did.</p>

<p>On the third daie when we should haue come vpon them, they had knowlege giuen
before day, and so retiring, got them to the mounteins, hasting fast toward Tholouse;
and the countrie people that were their guides to lead them that waie, were taken as they
should haue passed the water. And bicause the popes sergeant at armes was in my k&eacute;eping,
I caused him to examine the guides that were so taken; and for that the guide which
was thus examined, was the constables guide, and his countrieman, he might well s&eacute;e and
know the countenance of the Frenchmen vpon this examining him. And I said to the
same sergeant, that he might well declare to the pope, and to all them of Auignion, that
which he had heard or s&eacute;ene. And as touching the answer which my lord made to them
that were sent to treat with him, you would be well apaied if you vnderstood all the maner;
for he would not suffer in any wise that they shuld come n&eacute;erer vnto him. But if they
came to treat of anie matter, he would that they should send to the king his father: for
my lord himselfe would not doo any thing therin, except by commandement from my lord
his father.</p>

<p>And of my lords turning backe to follow after his enimies, and of the passage of the
riuer of Garonne, and of the taking of castels and townes in this iournie, and of other
things which he hath doone against his enimies in pursuit of them in this iournie, being
things right worthie and honorable, as manie know verie well, in like maner as sir Richard
Stafford, &amp; sir William Burton can more plainelie declare, than I to you can write, for
it were too much to put in writing. And my lord rode thus abroad in the countrie of his
enimies eight whole w&eacute;ekes, and rested not past eleuen daies in all those places where he
came. And know it for certeine, that since this warre began against the French king he
had neuer such losse or destruction as he hath had in this iournie: for the countries and
good townes which were wasted at this iournie, found to the king of France euerie yeare
more to the maintenance of his warre than halfe his realme hath doon beside, except the
exchange of his monie which he maketh euerie yeare, and the aduantage and custome which
he taketh of them of Poictou, as I can shew you by good remembrances, which were found
in diuerse townes in the receiuers houses: for Carcason and le Moignes, which is as great
as Carcason, and two other townes in the coasts of Carcason, found to the king of France
y&eacute;erelie wages for a thousand men of armes: and beside that 100000 old crowns to
mainteine the war.</p>

<p>And know you, that by the remembrances which we found, that the townes in Tholouse
which are destroied, and the townes in the countrie of Carcason, and the towne of Narbonne
and Narbonnois did find euerie yeare with the sums aforesaid, in aid of his war,
foure hundred thousand old crownes, as the burgesses of the great townes &amp; other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
of the countrie which ought to know it, haue told vs. And so by Gods assistance if my
lord had wherewith to mainteine this warre, and to make the kings profit and his owne
honor, he should well inlarge the English marches, and gaine manie faire places: for our
enimies are greatlie astonied. And at the making h&eacute;ereof, my lord hath appointed to
send all the earles and baronets to abide in certeine places on the marches, to make
roads, and to annoie his enimies. Now my lord, at this present I know none other
newes to send, but you may by your letters command me as yours to my power. My
right honorable lord, God grant you good life, ioy, health, long to continue. Written at
Burdeaux, the tuesdaie next before Christmasse.</p>

<p>&para; These letters haue I thought good to make the reader partaker of, as I find them in
the chronicle of Robert Auesburie, to the end ye may perceiue how other writers agr&eacute;e
therewith, sith the same letters may serue as a touchstone to trie the truth of the matter.
And so now I will returne to speake of the kings dooings in the north part where he left
him. On the fourt&eacute;enth of Ianuarie K. Edward hauing his armie lodged n&eacute;ere the towne
of Berwike, and his nauie readie in the hauen to assaile the Scots that were within the
towne, he entered the castell which the Englishmen had in their hands, the lord Walter
de Mannie being their capteine, who had gotten certeine miners thither from the forrest
of Deane, and other parts of the realme, which were busie to make passage vnder the
ground by a mine, through which the Englishmen might enter into the towne. Herevpon,
when the Scots perceiued in what danger they stood, and knew that they could not
long defend the towne against him, they surrendered it into his hands without further
resistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The resignation of the realme of Scotland made by the Balioll.</div>

<p>In the Scotish histories it is recorded, that when those which were within the towne of
Berwike, heard how that an armie of Englishmen came to the succours of the castell, they
raced the walles and burnt the houses of the towne, and so departed with all the spoile
which they had gotten there. But how soeuer it was, king Edward being againe possessed
of the towne, he set men aworke to repare it, and passing foorth to Roxburge, there met
with him the rightfull king of Scots Edward Balioll, who transferred &amp; resigned all the
right, title and interest, which he had or might haue to the crowne and realme of Scotland
into king Edwards hands: which resignatian he confirmed by his letters patents
thereof made and giuen vnder his hand and seale, dated the 25 of Ianuarie 1356, requiring
king Edward to perseuere in pursute of his title to the vttermost.</p>

<p>King Edward hauing thus receiued the resignation and release of the crowne of Scotland,
marched foorth with his armie, till he came to Hadington, burning and destroieng
the countrie on ech side round about him, as he passed. And whilest he laie there
abiding for his ships, his men of warre were not idle, but ranged abroad in the countrie,
and did all the damage to their enimies that they could deuise. At length his armie which
he had at the same time on the sea, arriued on that coast, and landing, spoiled a church
of our ladie called the White kirke: but being returned to their ships, there arose such a
tempest and vehement north wind, that manie of their vessels rushing and beating against
the banks and sands, were drowned togither with the men that were within them, for dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>pleasure
whereof king Edward fell to the spoile of the countrie againe, not sparing one
place more than another: by reason wherof, as well abbeis as all other churches and
religious houses both in Hadington, in Edenborough, and thorough all other the parts of
Louthian, wheresoeuer he came, were defaced and put to sacke. At length when he
had accomplished his will, and so set things in order, he returned backe into England with
the foresaid Edward Balioll in his companie, whome he kept with him, for doubt least he
should reuolt, and procure some new trouble. In the moneth of Iulie the duke of Lancaster
being sent to the aid of the K. of Nauarre, came into Constantine, which is a portion
of Normandie, &amp; there ioined with the lord Philip of Nauarre, brother to the king of
Nauarre, and with the lord Godfrie de Harecourt, the which being returned into France,
and restored to the French kings fauour, was latelie againe reuolted, vpon displeasure
taken for the death of his nephue the lord Iohn de Harecourt as in the French histories ye
may read more at large. They were in all about the number of foure thousand fighting
men, and being assembled togither, they went to Liseux, to Orbec, to Ponteau, &amp; rescued
the castell there, which had b&eacute;ene besieged by the lord Robert de Hotetot master of the
crossebowes in France, more than two moneths: but now hearing that the Englishmen
and Nauarrois approched, he departed from thence, leauing behind him for hast his engins

Eureux, which was as then in the Frenchmens hands, latelie y&eacute;elded to them after a long
siege, he went forward with the lord Philip de Nauarre in companie till they came to
Vernueill in Perch, and there tooke both the towne and castell, and robbed the towne and
burnt a great part therof. The French king, who had assembled a mightie armie, being
aduertised of these matters, hasted forward towards the duke of Lancaster, fullie purposing
to giue him battell. The duke and the lord Philip de Nauarre, hauing knowledge that the
French king followed them, withdrew towards the towne of the Eagle, and the king still
went after them, till he came to Tuebeuf two leages from the towne of the Egle, and
there it was shewed to him that he could not follow his enimies any further, by reason
of the thicke forrests, which he could not passe without great danger of his person and
losse of his people. Then returned he with all his host, and tooke from the Nauarrois
the castell of Thilliers, and also the castell of Bretueill, which was y&eacute;elded to him after two

<div class="sidenote">The passages stopped.</div>

<p>After this, they came before the citie of Burges, and there made a great skirmish at one
of the gates, and there were manie feats of armes doone. The host departed from thence,
without dooing anie more, and comming to a strong castell called Issoldune, they fiercelie
assailed it, but could not win it: the gentlemen within defended the walles and gates so
manfullie. Then passed they forward, and came to Vierzon, a great towne and a good
castell, but it was nothing stronglie fortified; and therefore was it woone perforce, the
people within it being not sufficient to resist the valiant puissance of the Englishmen.
Here they found wine and other vittels in great plentie, and herevpon they taried there
thr&eacute;e daies to refresh themselues at ease. But before they departed, the prince had aduertisement
giuen him that the French king was come to Chartres, with an huge assemblie of
men of warre, and that all the townes and passages aboue the riuer of Loire were closed
and kept. Then was the prince counselled to returne and passe by Touraine and Poictow,
and so that waie to Burdeaux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince returneth.</div>

<p>The prince following their aduise that thus counselled him, set forward toward Remorentine.
The French king had sent into that countrie to k&eacute;epe the frontiers there, the lord
of Craon, the lord Bouciquault, and the heremit of Chaumount, the which with thr&eacute;e
hundred men of armes had followed the Englishmen six daies togither, and could neuer
find anie conuenient occasion to set vpon them: for the Englishmen gouerned
themselues so sagelie, that their enimies could not lightlie assaile them, but to their
owne disaduantage. One day the Frenchmen laid themselues closelie in an ambush n&eacute;ere
to the towne of Remorentine, at a maruellous streict passage, by which the Englishmen
must n&eacute;eds passe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remorentine.</div>

<p>On the same daie there were departed from the princes battell, by licence of the marshals,
certeine capteins, Englishmen and Gascoignes, as the lord Bartholomew de Burgherce
or Burwasche (as some write him) the lord of Mucident Gascongne, monsieur
Petiton de Courton, the lord de la Ware, the lord Basset, sir Daniell Passelew, sir Richard
Ponchardon, sir Noell Loring, the yoong lord Spenser, and two of the Danbreticourts, sir
Edward, and an other, who hauing with them two hundred men of armes, went foorth to
run before Remorentine, that they might view the place. They passed foorth alongst
by the Frenchmen which laie in ambush, as y&eacute;e haue heard, and they were not aduised of
them, and they were no sooner passed, but that the Frenchmen brake out, and gallopped
after the Englishmen with great random, hauing their speares in their rests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A skirmish.</div>

<p>The Englishmen and the Gascoignes hearing horsses to come galloping after them,
turned, and perceiuing them to be their enimies, stood still to abide them. The Frenchmen
couragiouslie gaue the charge, and the Englishmen as valiantlie defended them, so that
there insued a great skirmish, which continued a long while, so that it could not be easilie
iudged who had the better, nor on which side the fortunate issue of the present conflict
would then fall (for</p>

<p>till that the battell of the English marshals approched, the which when the Frenchmen saw
comming by a wood side, they fled streightwaies towards Remorentine, and the Englishmen
followed in chase so fast as their horsses might beare them, and entered the towne with the
Frenchmen: but the French lords and the one halfe of their companie got into the castell,
and so saued themselues. The prince hearing what had happened, came into the towne,
and there lodged that night, sending sir Iohn Chandois to talke with the capiteines of the
castell, to know if they would y&eacute;eld: and bicause they refused so to doo, on the next
morrow he caused his people to giue an assault to the place, which continued the most part
of the day, but yet missing their purpose, he commanded that they should draw to their
lodgings, and rest them for that night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The castell of Remorentine assaulted.</div>

<p>In the morning as soone as the sunne was vp, the marshals caused the trumpets to sound,
and those that were appointed to giue the assault againe, prepared themselues to it. The
prince himselfe was present personallie at this assault, so that the same was inforced to
the vttermost: but when they saw that by assaults they could not win the castell, they
deuised engines, wherewith they cast wild fire into the base court, and so set it on fire,
which increased in such vehement sort, that it tooke into the couering of a great tower,
which was couered with r&eacute;ed: and then they within perceiuing they must either y&eacute;eld or
perish with fire, came downe and submitted themselues to the prince, who as prisoners
receiued them. The castell of Remorentine being thus woone and defaced with fire, the
prince left it void, and marched foorth with his armie as before, destroieng the countrie,
and approched to Aniou and Touraine. The French king came forwards toward the
prince, and at Ambois heard how the prince was in Touraine, meaning to returne through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Seuen thousand chosen men saith <i>Tho. Walsi.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Chauuignie.</div>

<p>Then came the king to Haie in Touraine, and his people were passed the riuer of Loire
at sundrie passages, where most conuenientlie they might. They were in number twentie
thousand men of armes; of noble men there were six and twentie, dukes and earles, beside
a great number of other lords and barons: the foure sonnes of the king were there, as the
lord Charles duke of Normandie, the lord Lewes after duke of Aniou, the lord Iohn after
duke of Berrie, and the lord Philip which was after duke of Burgongne. The French king
doubting least the prince should escape by sp&eacute;edie iournies out of his countrie, before he
could come to giue him battell, remooued to Chauuignie, and there passed the riuer of
Creuse by the bridge, supposing that the Englishmen had b&eacute;ene before him, but they were
not. Some of the Frenchmen taried behind at Chauuignie for one night, and in the morning
followed the king. They were about two hundred men of armes vnder the leading of
the lord Craon, the lord Raoull de Coucie, and the earle of Ioignie. They chanced to
incounter with certeine of the auaunt currours of the English armie, which remooued that
day from a little village fast by. Those Englishmen were not past thr&eacute;e score men of
armes, but well horssed, and therefore perceiuing the great number of the Frenchmen, they
fled towards the princes battell, which they knew was not farre off. Capteins of the Englishmen
were two knights of Heinault, the lord Eustace Dambreticourt, and the lord Iohn
of Guistelles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Raoull de Coucie taken.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Frenchmen distressed.</div>

<p>The Frenchmen beholding them in this wise to fl&eacute;e, rode after amaine, and as they followed
in chase, they came on the princes battell before they were aware. The lord Raoull
of Coucie went so far forward with his banner, that he entred vnder the princes banner,
and fought right valiantlie, but yet he was there taken, and the earle of Ioignie, also the
vicount of Bruce, the lord Chauuignie, and diuerse other, so that the most part of those
Frenchmen were either taken or slaine, and verie few escaped. The prince vnderstood by
the prisoners, that the French king was so farre aduanced forward in pursute of him, that
he could not auoid the battell. Then he assembled his men togither, and commanded
them to k&eacute;epe order, and so rode that day being saturdaie from morning till it was toward
night, &amp; then came within two leagues of Poictiers: and herewith sending foorth certeine
capteins, to search if they could heare where the king was, he incamped himselfe that
night in a strong place amongst hedges, vines, and bushes. They that were sent to discouer
the countrie, rode so far, that they saw where the French king with his great battell was
marching, and setting vpon the taile of the Frenchmen, caused all the host to stir: whereof
knowledge being giuen to the king, the which as then was entring into Poictiers, he returned
againe, and made all his host to doo the like, so that it was verie late yer he and his
people were bestowed in their lodgings that night. The English currours returning to
the prince, declared what they had s&eacute;ene and doone. So, that night, the two armies
being lodged within a small distance either of other, kept strong and sure watch about
their campes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ordering of the French battell.</div>

<p>On the morrow after being sundaie, and the eight&eacute;enth daie of September, the French
king caused his host to be diuided into thr&eacute;e battels or wards, and in each of them were
sixt&eacute;ene thousand armed men, all mustered and passed for armed men. The first battell
was gouerned by the duke of Orleance, wherein were six and thirtie banners, and twise as
manie penons. The second was led by the duke of Normandie and his brethren, the lord
Lewes &amp; the lord Iohn. The third the French king himselfe conducted. And while these
battels were setting in arraie, the king caused the lord Eustace de Ribaumount, and two
other noble men to ride on before, to s&eacute;e the dealing of the Englishmen, and to aduise of
what number they were. Those that were thus sent, rode foorth and beheld the order of
the Englishmen at good leisure: and returning, infourmed the king, that as they could
iudge, the enimies were about two thousand men of armes, foure thousand archers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>
fift&eacute;ene hundred of others, and that they were lodged in such a strong place, and so well
fensed with ditches and hedges, that it would be hard assaulting them therein.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cardinal of Piergort.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The prince of Wales contented to come to a treatie.</div>

<p>The cardinall of Piergort the popes legat, as then lieng in the citie of Poictiers, came that
morning to the king, and required him to absteine from battell, till he might vnderstand
whether the prince would condescend vnto such conditions of peace as he himselfe should
think reasonable, which if it might be brought to passe, the same should be more honorable
for him, than to aduenture so manie noble men as were there with him at that present
in hazard of battell. The king was contented that the cardinall should go to the
prince, and s&eacute;e what he could doo with him. The cardinall rode to the prince, and
talked with him till he was contented to come to a treatie. The cardinall returned to the
French king, and required of him that a truce might be granted till the next daies sun-rising:
which truce obteined, he spent that daie in riding to and fro betwixt them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The offer of the prince of Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French kings presumptuous demand.</div>

<p>The prince offered to render into the kings hands all that he had woone in that voiage,
as well townes as castels, and also to release all the prisoners, which he or any of his men
had taken in that iournie: and further he was contented to haue b&eacute;ene sworne not to
beare armour against the French king within the terme of seuen yeares next following.
But the French king would not agr&eacute;e therevnto: the vttermost that he would agr&eacute;e vnto,
was this, that the prince and an hundred of his knights should y&eacute;eld themselues as
prisoners vnto him, otherwise he would not haue the matter taken vp. But it was the
French kings hap after (notwithstanding his hautines) to be taken captiue, as Okland
noteth, saieng,</p>

<span class="i0">---- seruilia sub iuga missus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disceret vt domino regi par&ecirc;re Britanno.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the prince in no wise cold be brought to any such vnreasonable conditions, and so the
cardinall could not make them fr&eacute;ends, although he trauelled earnestlie betwixt them all
that daie. When it drew towards night, he returned toward Poictiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Englishmen fortifie their campe.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The cardinall trauelled in vaine.</div>

<p>The Englishmen were not idle, whilest the cardinall was thus in hand to bring the parties
to some good agr&eacute;ement, but cast great ditches, and made hedges, and other fortifications
about the place where their archers stood, and on the next morning, being mondaie, the
prince and his people prepared themselues to receiue battell, as they had doone before,
hauing passed the day before and that night in great defect of necessarie things, for they
could not stir abroad to fetch forrage or other prouisions without danger to be surprised
of their enimies. The cardinall came againe earlie in the morning vnto the French king,
and found the French armie readie in order of battell by that time the sunne was vp, and
though he eftsoones fell in hand to exhort the king to an agr&eacute;ement, yet it would not be.
So he went to the prince, and declared to him how he could doo no good in the matter, and
therefore he must abide the hazard of battell for ought that he could s&eacute;e: wherewith the
prince was content, and so the cardinall returned vnto Poictiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tho. Wals.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">A prophesie of a prelate.</div>

<p>&para; Here is to be remembred, that when (as Thomas Walsingham writeth) this cardinall
of Piergort was sent from the pope to traueil betwixt the parties for a peace to be had, and
that the pope exhorted him verie earnestlie to shew his vttermost diligence and indeuour
therein: at his setting foorth to go on that message, the said cardinall (as was said) made
this answer: Most blessed father (said he) either we will persuade them to peace and
quietnesse, either else shall the verie flintstones crie out of it. But this he spake not of
himselfe, as it was supposed, but being a prelate in that time, he prophesied what should
follow; for when the English archers had bestowed all their arrowes vpon their enimies,
they tooke vp pebles from the place where they stood, being full of those kind of stones,
and approching to their enimies, they threw the same with such violence on them, that
lighting against their helmets, armor, and targets, they made a great ringing noise, so that
the cardinals prophesie was fulfilled, that he would either persuade a peace, or else the
stones should crie out thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[Pg 666]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The exhortation of the prince.</div>

<p>The worthie prince like a couragious chiefteine, when he saw that he must n&eacute;eds fight,
required his people not to be abashed at the great number of their enimies, sith the victorie
did not consist in the multitude of men, but where God would send it: and if it
fortuned that the iournie might be theirs and his, they should be the most honored people
of the world: and if they should die in that righteous quarrell, he had the king his
father and also his brethren, in like case as they had fr&eacute;ends and kinsmen, that would s&eacute;eke
their reuenge. And therefore he desired them that daie to shew themselues like valiant
men of warre: and for his part he trusted in God and saint George, they should s&eacute;e in
his person no default. These or the like words did this most gentle prince speake, which
greatlie comforted all his people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Noble men with the prince of Wales.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The capitall de Beuf.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The number of the prince his armie.</div>

<p>There were with him of earles, Warwike, Suffolke, Salisburie, Stafford; of lords, Cobham
Spenser, Audeley, Berkley, Basset, Warren, de la Ware, Bradeston, Burwasch,
Felton, Mallow, and diuerse other: also sir Iohn Chandois, by whome he was much
counselled, sir Richard Stafford, sir Richard of Penbruche, and manie other knights and
valiant esquires of England. Moreouer, there was of Gascoigne, the capitall of Buz or
Beuf, the lords of Prumes, Burguenrie, Chaumount, de Lespare, Rosen, Monferant,
Landuras, the Souldich of Lestrad or Lescard, and other; and of Heinault, sir Eustace
Daubreticourt, sir Iohn de Guistelles, and other strangers. All the princes companie
passed not the number of eight thousand men one and other, of the which (as Iacobus
Meire saith) thr&eacute;e thousand were archers: though Froissard (as I haue rehearsed before)
reporteth the number of archers to be more, as in one place six thousand, and in an other
place foure thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The number of the French.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The battell is begun.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The force of the English archer.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Iames Audeley.</div>

<p>The French king hauing in his armie thr&eacute;e score thousand fighting men, wherof there
were more than thr&eacute;e thousand knights, made so sure account of victorie, as anie man might
of a thing not yet had, considering his great puissance, in regard to the small number of his
aduersaries: and therefore immediatlie after that the cardinall was departed, he caused his
battels to march forward, and approching to the place where the Englishmen stood readie
to receiue their enimies, caused the onset to be giuen. There were certeine French
horssemen, to the number of thr&eacute;e hundred, with the Almains also on horssebacke appointed
to breake the arraie of the English archers, but the archers were so defended and
compassed about with hedges and ditches, that the horssemen of the French part could
not enter to doo their feat, and being galled with the sharpe shot of the English bowes,
they were ouerthrowne horsse and man, so that the vaward of the Frenchmen, wherein
was the duke of Athens, with the marshals of France, the lord Iohn de Cleremont, and
the lord Arnold Dandrehen or Odenhen, began to disorder within a while, by reason of
the shot of the archers, togither with the helpe of the men of armes, amongst whome in
the forefront was the lord Iames Audeley, to performe a vow which he had made, to be
one of the first setters on.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tho. Walsi.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earles of Warwike and Suffolke.</div>

<p>There was the lord Arnold Dandrehen taken prisoner, and the lord Iohn de Cleremont
slaine, so that the noble prowesse of the said lord Iames Audeley, breaking through the
Frenchmens battell with the slaughter of manie enimies, was that day most apparant.
The loiall constancie of the noble earles of Warwike and Suffolke, that fought so stoutlie,
so earnestlie, and so fiercelie, was right manifest. And the prince himselfe did not onelie
fulfill the office of a noble ch&eacute;efteine, but also of a right valiant and expert souldiour,
attempting what soeuer any other hardie warriour would in such cases haue done. Neither
was this battell quicklie dispatched, nor easilie brought to end; but it was fought
out with such obstinate earnestnesse, that thr&eacute;e times that daie were the Englishmen
driuen to renew the fight, through the multitude of enimies that increased and came still
vpon them.</p>

<p>Finallie, the marshals battell was quite discomfited: for the Frenchmen and Almains
fell one vpon an other, and could not passe foorth; and those that were behind, &amp; could
not get forward, reculed backe: and while the marshals battell being on horssebacke
thus assailed the English armie with great disaduantage, and was in the end beaten backe,
the two battels of the dukes of Normandie and Orleance came forward, and likewise
assailed the Englishmen, but could not preuaile. The archers shot so fiercelie, that to
conclude, the Frenchmen behind, vnderstanding the discomfiture of the marshals battell,
and how their fellowes before could not enter vpon their enimies, they opened and ran to
their horsses, in whome they did put more trust for their safegard by galloping on them
awaie, than in their manlike hands, for all their late brauerie and great boasts. One
thing sore discouraged the Frenchmen, and that was this: beside those Englishmen that
were within the closure of their campe, there were certeine men of armes on horssebacke,
with a number of archers also on horssebacke, appointed to coast vnder the couert of a
mounteine, adioining to the place, where they thought to strike into a side of the duke
of Normandies battell, so that with the terrour hereof, and with the continuall shot of the
English archers, the Frenchmen not knowing where to turne themselues, sought to saue
their liues by flight.</p>

assailed the maine battell of the Frenchmen, where the king himselfe was, who like a
valiant prince would not fl&eacute;e, but fought right manfullie: so that if the fourth part of his
men had doone halfe their parts as he did his, the victorie by likelihood had rested (as
Froissard saith) on his side: but he was forsaken of his thr&eacute;e sonnes, and of his brother
the duke of Orleance, which fled out of the battell with cleare hands. Finallie, after huge
slaughter made of those noblemen, and other which abode with him euen to the end, he
was taken, and so likewise was his yongest sonne Philip, and both put in great danger to
haue b&eacute;ene murthered after they were taken, by the Englishmen and Gascoignes, striuing
who should haue the king to his prisoner, where ind&eacute;ed a knight of Flanders or rather
Artois, borne in saint Omers, called sir Denise Morbecke, tooke him, but he was
streightwaies taken from the same sir Denise by other that came in the meane season, better

bishop of Chaalons, sir Eustace de Ribaumont, with diuerse other to the number of eight
hundred lords, knights, and gentlemen of name. In all there died on the French part
six thousand of one and other. The chase was continued euen to the gates of Poictiers,
and manie slaine and beaten downe in the str&eacute;et before the gates, which the citizens had
closed, for doubt least the Englishmen should enter with them that fled, thither for safegard.
There were taken beside the king and his sonne, the lord Iaques de Burbon earle
of Ponthieu, brother to the duke of Burbon that was slaine there, the earle of Ew, the
lord Charles his brother earle of Longuile, the archbishop of Sens, the earle of Vandosme,

that was killed in Spaine, the marshall Dandrehen or Odenhen (as Iacobus Meir saith)
with others to the number of seuent&eacute;ene hundred earles, lords, knights, and gentlemen,
beside those of the meaner sort; so that the Englishmen had twise as manie prisoners as
they themselues were in number: and therefore it was deuised amongst them, to put the
most part of their prisoners to ransome there in the field, and so they did for doubt of
further danger, the multitude being so great as it was.</p>

roiall, with the supreme type of your kinglie maiestie, remaineth whole and inuiolate,
and what soeuer may rightlie be called yours; so that no violent force of time shall blot
out or diminish the same. The almightie God hath determined that the chance of war
shall rest in his disposition and will, as all other things. Your elders haue atchiued both
by land &amp; sea manie noble enterprises. The whole compasse of Europe, all the east
parts of the world, all places and countries, both far &amp; n&eacute;ere, are full of monuments, witnessing
the noble victories atteined by the French people.</p>

<p>The cause of godlie liuing and religion, the dignitie and preheminence of christianitie
hath b&eacute;ene defended and augmented by you, against the most mightie and puissant capteins
of the infidels, enimies to the said christian religion. All ages shall make mention
of your worthie praises, no nation there is but shall confesse it selfe bounden at one
time or other for benefits receiued at your hands; neither is there any people but such
as hope to be hereafter bounden to you for reliefe and benefits, to proc&eacute;ed from you in
time to come. One or two battels happilie haue chanced among so manie triumphs otherwise
than you would haue wished; chance would it should be so, which may inf&eacute;eble and
make weake the power of horsses, armor, and weapon: your inuincible courage and
roiall magnanimitie lieth in your power to reteine: neither shall this day take any thing
from you or yours. And this realme of France which hath procreat and brought foorth
and norished so many of my noble progenitors, shall perceiue my good meaning towards
hir, as not forgetfull of mine elders, and toward your maiestie (if you will vouchsafe that
I should glorie of that name) a most humble kinsman. There are manie occasions of
loue and fr&eacute;endship betwixt you and my father, which I trust shall take place, for I know
all his thoughts and inward meanings: you shall agr&eacute;e and come to an attonement right
easilie togither, &amp; I praie God he neuer take me for his sonne, except I haue you in the
same degr&eacute;e of honor, reuerence, and faithfull loue, which I owe towards him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Audelie rewarded.</div>

<p>The king (as reason would) acknowledged this to proc&eacute;ed of great courtesie shewed toward
him in the prince, and thanked him accordinglie. And the prince performing in d&eacute;ed
that which he spake with word, ceassed from further vsing of fire, or other indamaging of
the French dominions, and taking his waie through the countries of Poictou and Xaintonge,
by easie iournies, he and his people came to Blaie, and so passed ouer the water
to Burdeaux in good safetie with all their riches and prisoners. The prince gaue to the
lord Iames Audelie (who had receiued in the battell manie sore wounds) fiue hundred
marks of yearelie reuenues assigned foorth of his lands in England. The which gift the
knight granted as fr&eacute;elie as he had receiued it vnto foure of his esquiers, which in the
battell had b&eacute;ene euer attendant about his person, without whose aid &amp; valiant support,
he knew well that he had b&eacute;ene slaine sundrie times in the same battell by his enimies,
and therefore thought it a dutie of humanitie and gratitude to make them amends with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[Pg 669]</a></span>
temporall recompense, that had saued his life, than the which nothing is more d&eacute;ere, nor
of greater price in the world, as the poet saith,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">---- nihil est vita pretiosius ipsa.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the prince heard that he had so doone, he meruelled what his meaning was
therby, and caused him to be brought before his presence, and demanded of him wherefore
he had so lightlie giuen awaie that reward which he had bestowed vpon him, and
whether he thought that gift too meane for him or not. The lord Audelie so excused
himselfe in extolling the good seruice doone to him by his esquiers, through whome he had
so manie times escaped the dangers of death, that the prince did not onelie confirme the
resignation of the fiue hundred marks giuen to the esquiers, but also rewarded the lord
Audelie with six hundred marks more of like yearelie reuenues, in maner and forme as he
had receiued the other.</p>

<p>When the newes of this great victorie came into England of the ouerthrow of the Frenchmen,
and taking of the French king, ye may be sure there was great ioy shewed by outward
tokens, as bonfiers made, feasts and bankets kept, through the whole realme. Likewise
the Gascoignes and Englishmen being come to Burdeaux, made great reuell and
pastime there, spending fr&eacute;elie that gold and siluer which they had woone in the battell
of Poictiers, and elsewhere in that iournie. &para; This yeare in Aprill the prince of Wales
tooke shipping with his prisoners at Burdeaux, and on the fift of Maie arriued at Plimouth.
On the foure and twentith day of Maie he was with great honour ioifullie receiued
of the citizens into the citie of London, and so conueied to the palace of Westminster,
where the king sitting in Westminster hall, receiued the French king, and after
conueied him to a lodging appointed for him, where he laie a season; but after he was remoued
to the Sauoie, which was at that time a goodlie house, perteining to the duke of
Lancaster, though afterwards it was burnt and destroied by Wat Tiler, Iacke Straw, and
their companie. In this place the French king laie, and kept house a long time after.</p>

was reported, that the French king could not so dissemble nor cloake his inward thought,

<p>About the same time there came ouer into England two cardinals, the one called Talirand
being bishop of Alba (commonlie named the cardinall of Pierregort) and the other
named Nicholas intituled cardinall of S. Vitale or (as Froissard saith) of Dargell, they
were sent from pope Innocent the sixt, to intreat for a peace betwixt the kings of England
and France: but they could not bring their purpose to anie perfect conclusion,
although they remained here for the space of two yeares: but yet onelie by good means
they procured a truce betw&eacute;ene the said kings, and all their assistants, to indure from
the time of the publication thereof, vnto the feast of S. Iohn Baptist, which should be
in the yeare 1359: out of the which truce was excepted the L. Philip of Nauarre, and

and the lord Philip his sonne with him, all the residue of the prisoners abode still
at London, but were suffered to go vp and downe, and to come to the court when they

to the king of Nauarre vpon the tenth day of March earlie in the morning scaled the walles
of the citie of Auxerre, and behaued them so manfullie, that they were maisters of the
towne before the sunne was vp. They got exc&eacute;eding much by the spoile of that citie,
and by ransoming the prisoners which they tooke there. At length after they had remained
eight daies in that citie, and taken their pleasures of all things within it, they
wrought so with the citizens, that to haue possession of their citie againe, and to haue
it saued from fire, they agr&eacute;ed to giue to sir Robert Knolles, and to his companie, fiftie
thousand motons of gold, which amounted to the summe of twelue thousand and fiue

should burne the gates, and throw downe the walles in diuers places. In Aprill next
insuing, the towne of Da&uacute;bignie sir le Metre was likewise woone by the Englishmen;
and the second daie of Maie Chastelon sir Loigne was taken by the said sir Robert
Knolles, and put to sacke as the other were. From thence they went to Newcastell vpon
Loire. Thus did the Englishmen and other, in title of the K. of Nauarre, greatlie indamage

<p>Great discord rose also about this time, or rather afore, betwixt the cleargie, and the

Fox ye may read more at large. In this yeare Iohn of Gant earle of Richmond, sonne
to the king, the ninet&eacute;enth day of Maie married the ladie Blanch daughter to Henrie duke
of Lancaster at Reading; and bicause they were cousins within the degr&eacute;es of consanguinitie,
forbidden by the church lawes to marrie, a dispensation was procured of the
pope to remoue that obstacle and let. In this yeare the king set workemen in hand to
take downe much old bildings belonging to the castell of Windsore, and caused diuerse
other faire and sumptuous works to be erected and set vp, in and about the same castell,
so that almost all the masons and carpenters that were of any accompt within this land,
were sent for and imploied about the same works, the ouers&eacute;er whereof was William
Wickham the kings chaplein, by whose aduise the king tooke in hand to repare that
place, the rather in d&eacute;ed bicause he was borne there, and therefore he tooke great pleasure
to bestow cost in beautifieng it with such buildings, as may appeare euen vnto this
daie. Moreouer, this yeare in the Rogation w&eacute;eke was solemne iusts enterprised at
London, for the maior and his foure and twentie brethren as challengers did appoint to

Lionell, Iohn, and Edmund, and ninet&eacute;ene other great lords, in secret manner came and
held the field with honor, to the great pleasure of the citizens that beheld the same. &para;Ye
haue heard how the Frenchmen refused the peace, which was accorded betwixt K. Edward
&amp; their king, as then prisoner here in England. Wherup&#x014D; K. Edward determined
to make such warre against the realme of France, that the Frenchmen with all their harts
should be glad to condescend and agr&eacute;e to reason: and first he commanded all manner
of Frenchmen (other than such as were prisoners) to auoid out of England. He also
appointed the French king to be remoued from the castell of Hertford, where he then
remained, vnto the castell of Somerton in Lincolneshire, vnder the gard and conduct of
the lord William Deincourt, being allowed fourtie shillings the day for the wages of two and
twentie men at armes, twentie archers, &amp; two watchmen: as thus, for himselfe and sir
Iohn Kirketon baronets, either of them foure shillings the daie; for thr&eacute;e knights, sir
William Colleuill (in place of the lord Robert Colleuill, that could not trauell himselfe
by reason of sicknesse) sir Iohn Deincourt, and sir Saer de Rochfort, ech of them two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>

on horsse backe euerie of them six pence the day, and twelue archers on foot thr&eacute;e pence,
and the two watchmen either of them six pence the day, which amounteth in the whole
vnto nine and thirtie shillings the day; and the od twelue pence was allowed to the said
lord Deincourt to make vp the summe of 40 shillings. &para; This haue I noted the rather,
to giue a light to the reader to consider how chargeable the reteining of men of war in these
daies is, in respect of the former times. But now to our purpose.</p>

to Calis with foure hundred speares, and two thousand archers, where the said duke
ioined with such strangers as were alreadie come to Calis in great numbers, and togither
with them entered into the French dominions, and passing by saint Omers &amp; Bethune,
came to Mount saint Eloie, a goodlie abbeie and a rich, two leagues distant from Arras,
and there the host tarried foure daies, and when they had robbed and wasted all the
countrie thereabout, they rode to Braie, and there made a great assault, at the which
a baronet of England was slaine with diuerse other. When the Englishmen saw they
could win nothing there, they departed, and following the water of Some, came to a towne

with all his companie. The duke according to the kings commandement obeied, and so
returned toward Calis. The king being there arriued with all his power, tooke counsell
which way he should take. Some aduised him first to inuade Flanders, and to reuenge
the iniurious dealing of the earle and the Flemings: but he would not agr&eacute;e to that motion,
for he purposed fullie either by plaine force to make a conquest of France, or else vtterlie
to destroie and wast the countrie throughout with fier and sword. Herevpon he set forwards
the fourth of Nouember, and passing through the countries of Arthois, and Vermendois,
he came before the citie of Reimes. There went ouer with him in this iournie,
&amp; with the duke of Lancaster, his foure sonnes, Edward prince of Wales, Lionell earle of
Vlster, Iohn earle of Richmond, and the lord Edmund his yoongest sonne. Also there
was Henrie the said duke of Lancaster, with the earles of March, Warwike, Suffolke,
Hereford (who also was earle of Northampton) Salisburie, Stafford, and Oxford, the
bishops of Lincolne, and Durham, and the lords Percie, Neuill, Spenser, Kirdiston, Rosse,

and other capiteins within it, that the Englishmen could not obteine their purpose, and so
at length, when they could not haue forrage nor other necessarie things abroad in the
countrie for to serue their turne, the king raised his field, and departed with his armie
in good order of battell, taking the way through Champaigne, and so passed by Chaalons,
and after to Merie on the riuer of Seine. From Merie he departed and came vnto Tonnere,
which towne about the beginning of the foure and thirtith yeare of his reigne was
woone by assault, but the castell could not be woone, for there was within it the lord
Fiennes constable of France, and a great number of other good men of war, which defended
it valiantlie.</p>

<p>The chancellor, and the other Burgognian lords found the king so agr&eacute;eable to their
request, that a composition was made betwixt him and the countrie of Burgognie, so that
he should make to them an assurance for him, and all his people, not to ouerrun or indamage
that countrie, during the space of thr&eacute;e yeares, and he to haue in readie monie the
summe of two hundred thousand florens of gold, which of sterling monie amounted to the
summe of fiue and thirtie thousand pounds. When this agr&eacute;ement was ingrossed vp in
writing, and sealed, the king dislodged, and all his host, taking the right waie to Paris, and
passing the riuer of Yonne, entered into Gastinois, and at length by easie iournies, vpon a
tuesdaie being the last of March in the w&eacute;eke before Easter, he came and lodged betw&eacute;ene
Mont le Herie, and Chartres, with his people in the countrie there abouts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A treatie.</div>

<p>Here the duke of Normandie made meanes for a treatie of peace, which was laboured
by a frier called Simon de Langres prouinciall of the friers Iacobins and the popes legat:
he did so much, that a treatie was appointed to be holden on good fridaie in the Malederie
of Longegimew, where appeared for the king of England the duke of Lancaster, the erls of
Warwike and Northampton, with sir Iohn Chandois, sir Walter de Mannie, and sir William
Cheinie knights: and for the French king thither came the earle of Eu constable of
France, and the marshall Bouciquaut, with other; but their treatie came to none effect:
wherfore the king vpon the tuesdaie in the Easter w&eacute;eke remooued n&eacute;erer vnto Paris, and
vpon the fridaie following, being the tenth of Aprill, by procurement of the abbat of
Clugnie newlie come from pope Innocent the sixt, the foresaid commissioners eftsoones
did m&eacute;et to treat of an agr&eacute;ement, but nothing they could conclude, the parties in their
offers and demands were so farre at ods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Englishmen before Paris.</div>

<p>Vpon the sundaie next following, a part of the kings hoste came before the citie of
Paris, and imbattelled themselues in a field fast by saint Marcilles, abiding there fr&#x014D; morning
till thr&eacute;e of the clocke in the after noone, to s&eacute;e if the Frenchmen would come foorth
to giue battell: but the French would not taste of that vessel. For the duke of Normandie

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Beauuois.</div>

<p>would not suffer anie of his people to issue foorth of the gates, but commanded them to be
readie onelie to defend the walles and gates, although he had a great power of men of
warre within the citie, beside the huge multitude of the inhabitants. The Englishmen
to prouoke their enimies the sooner to saile forth, burnt diuerse parts of the suburbs, and
rode euen to the gates of the citie. When they perceiued that the Frenchmen would not
come foorth, about thr&eacute;e of the clocke in the afternoone they departed out of the field
and withdrew to their campe, and then the king and all the English host remooued
towards Chartres, and was lodged at a place called Dones. Thither came to him the
bishop of Beauuois then chancellor of Normandie, with other, and so handled the
matter with him, that a new daie of treatie was appointed to be holden at Bretignie,
which is little more then a mile distant from Chartres, vpon the first day of Maie next
insuing.</p>

<p>In which daie and place appointed, the foresaid duke of Lancaster, and the said earles
and other commissioners met with the said bishop, and other French lords and spirituall
men to him associate, on the behalfe of the duke of Normandie then regent of France, to
renew the former communication of peace, in full hope to bring it to a good conclusion;
bicause king Edward began to frame his imagination more to accord with his aduersaries,
than he had doone of late, ch&eacute;efelie for that the duke of Lancaster with courteous words
and sage persuasions, aduised him not to forsake such reasonable conditions as the Frenchmen
were contented now to agr&eacute;e vnto, sith that by making such manner of warre as he
had attempted, his souldiers onelie gained, and he himselfe lost but time, and consumed his
treasure: and further he might warre in this sort all the daies of his life, before he could
atteine to his intent, and loose perhaps in one daie more than he had gained in twentie
yeares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An hideous storme &amp; tempest of wether.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A peace concluded.</div>

<p>Such words spoken for the wealth of the king and his subiects, conuerted the kings
mind to fansie peace, namelie by the grace of the Holie-ghost ch&eacute;efe worker in this case.
For it chanced on a daie, as he was marching not farre from Chartres, there came such a
storm and tempest of thunder, lightening, haile and raine, as the like had neuer b&eacute;ene
s&eacute;ene by anie of the English people. This storme fell so hideous in the kings host, that it
s&eacute;emed the world should haue ended: for such vnreasonable great stones of haile fell from
the skie, that men and horsses were slaine therewith, so that the most hardie were abashed.
There perished thousands thereby, as some haue written. Then the king remembring
what reasonable offers of agr&eacute;ement he had refused, vpon remorse of conscience (as by
some writers should appeare) asked forgiuenesse of the damage doone by sword
and fire in those parts, and fullie determined to grant vnto indifferent articles of peace,
for rel&eacute;efe of the christian inhabitants of that land: and so shortlie after, by the good
diligence of the commissioners on both parts, an vnitie and finall peace was accorded,
the conditions whereof were comprised in fortie and one articles, the chiefe whereof in
effect were these.</p>

<p>1 First that the king of England should haue and enioy (ouer and beside that which he held
alreadie in Gascoigne and Guien) the castell, citie, and countie of Poictiers, and all the lands
and countrie of Poictou, with the f&eacute;e of Touars, and the lands of Belleuille; the citie and castell
of Xainctes, and all the lands and countrie of Xaonctonge on both sides the riuer of Charent,
with the towne and fortresse of Rochell, with their appurtenances; the citie and castell
of Agent, and the countrie of Agenois; the citie and castell of Piergort, and all the land and
countrie of Perigueux; the citie and castell of Limoges, and all the lands and countrie of
Limosin; the citie and castell of Cahors, and the lordship of Cahorsin; the castell and countrie
of Tarbe; the lands countrie and countie of Bigorre; the countie, countrie, and lands of
Gaure; the citie and castell of Angolesme; and the countie, land, and countrie of Angolesmois;
the citie, towne and castell of Rodaix; and all the countie, and countrie of
Rouergne; and if there were in the duchie of Guien any lords, as the earles of Foiz, Arminacke,
Lisle, and Perigueux, the vicounts of Carmain, and Limoges, or other holding
any lands within the foresaid bounds, it was accorded that they should doo homage and
other customarie seruices due for the same vnto the king of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The date of the charter of the peace.</div>

<p>2 It was also agr&eacute;ed, that Calis and Guines with the appurtenances, the lands of Montreuill
on the sea with the countie of Ponthieu, wholie and entirelie should remaine vnto
the king of England. All the which countries, cities, townes, and castels, with the other
lands and seigniories, the same king should haue and hold to him and his heires for euer,
euen as they were in demaine or f&eacute;e, immediatlie of God, and fr&eacute;e without recognizing
any maner souereingtie to any earthlie man. In consideration whereof, king Edward
renounced all such claimes, titles and interest as he pretended vnto any part of France,
other than such as were comprised within the charter of couenants of this peace first
agr&eacute;ed vpon at Bretignie aforesaid, and after confirmed at Calis, as appeareth, by the
same charter dated there the foure &amp; twentith daie of October, in the yeare of our Lord
1360.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French kings ransome.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Hostages.</div>

<p>3 It was also couenanted, that the French king should paie vnto the king of England
thirtie hundred thousand crownes in name of his ransome: for assurance of which paiment,
&amp; performance of all the couenants afore mentioned, and other agr&eacute;ed vpon by this
peace, the dukes of Orleance, Aniou, Berrie, and Burbon, with diuerse other honorable
personages, as earles, lords, and burgesses of euerie good towne, some were appointed to
be sent ouer hither into England to remaine as hostages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French not to aid the Scots.</div>

<p>4 It was further agr&eacute;ed, that neither the French king nor his successors should aid the
Scots against the king of England or his successors; nor that king Edward nor his heirs
kings of England should aid the Flemings against the crowne of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Britaine.</div>

<p>5 And as for the title or right of the duchie of Britaine, which was in question betw&eacute;ene
the earles of Blois and Mountfort, it was accorded, that both kings being at Calis, the
parties should be called before them, and if the two kings could not make them fr&eacute;ends,
then should they assigne certeine indifferent persons to agr&eacute;e them, and they to haue halfe
a y&eacute;eres respit to end the matter: and if within that terme those that should be so appointed
to agr&eacute;e them, could not take vp the matter betwixt the said earles, then either of
them might make the best purchase for himselfe that he could, by helpe of fr&eacute;ends, or
otherwise: but alwaies prouided, that neither of the kings nor their sonnes should so aid
the said earles, whereby the peace accorded betwixt England and France, might by any
meanes be broken or infringed. Also, to whether of the said earles the duchie of Britaine
in the end chanced to fall by sentence of iudges, or otherwise, the homage should be doone
for the same vnto the French king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike.</div>

<p>All these ordinances, articles and agr&eacute;ements, with manie mo (which here would be
too long to rehearse) were accorded and ratified by the instruments and scales of the
prince of Wales on the one part, and of the duke of Normandie regent of France on the
other part, as by their letters patents then sealed further appeared, bearing date, the one at
Loures in Normandie the sixt&eacute;enth daie of Maie in the yeare of Grace 1360, and the
other at Paris the tenth day of the same moneth, and in the yeare aforesaid. Ouer &amp;
beside this, both the said princes tooke on them a solemne oth, to s&eacute;e all the same articles
and couenants of agr&eacute;ement throughlie kept, mainteined and performed. This doone,
king Edward imbarked himselfe with his four sonnes and the most part of his nobles at
Hunfleu the twentith daie of Maie, and so sailed into England, leauing behind him the
earle of Warwike to haue the gouernement of all the men of warre which he left behind
him, either in Guien or in any other place on that side the sea.</p>

<p>There died in this iournie diuerse noble men of this land, as the earles of March and
Oxford, the lord Iohn Graie then steward of England, and the lord Geffrie de Saie, with
diuerse other. The eight of Iulie next insuing, the French king hauing licence to depart,
landed at Calis, and was lodged in the castell there, abiding till the king of England came
thither, which was not till the ninth day of October next after. On the foure and twentith
daie of October, both the kings being in two trauerses and one chappell at Calis, a masse
was said before them, and when they should haue kissed the pax, either of them in signe
of greater fr&eacute;endship kissed the other, &amp; there they were solemnlie sworne to mainteine
the articles of the same peace; and for more assurance thereof, manie lords of both
parts were likewise sworne to mainteine the same articles to the vttermost of their powers.
Whilest these kings laie thus at Calis, there was great banketting and ch&eacute;ere made betwixt
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Normandie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The number of the French hostages.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The French king set at libertie.</div>

<p>Also the duke of Normandie came from Bullongne to Calis, to visit his father, and to
s&eacute;e the king of England, in which meane time two of king Edwards sonnes were at Bullongne.
Finallie, when these two kings had finished all matters in so good order and
forme that the same could not be amended nor corrected, and that the French king had
deliuered his hostages to the king of England, that is to saie, six dukes, beside earles,
lords, and other honorable personages, in all to the number of eight and thirtie: on the
morrow after the taking of their oths, that is to saie on the fiue and twentith daie of October,
being sundaie, the French king was fr&eacute;elie deliuered, and the same daie before noone
he departed from Calis, and rode to Bullongne. The king of England brought him a mile
foreward on his waie, and then tooke leaue of him in most louing maner. The prince
attended him to Bullongne, where both he and the duke of Normandie with other were
eftsoons sworne to hold and mainteine the foresaid peace without all fraud or colourable
deceit: and this doone, the prince returned to Calis. Thus was the French king set at
libertie, after he had b&eacute;ene prisoner here in England the space of foure yeares, and as
much as from the ninet&eacute;enth daie of September, vnto the fiue and twentith of October.
When the king of England had finished his businesse at Calis, according to his mind, he
returned into England, and came to London the ninth daie of Nouember.</p>

<p>&para; Thus haue y&eacute;e hard the originall begining, the processe, and issue of sundrie conflicts
and battels, and speciallie of two, one of Iohn the French king vnluckilie attempted
against England; the other of Dauid the Scotish king as vnfortunatlie ended. For both
kings were subdued in fight, vanquished, and taken prisoners; with a great number of
their noblemen, whereas they were in hope to haue gone awaie with the conquest, and to
haue had renowme for their reward. Of which ouerthrow giuen to both these kings, with
the clemencie of king Edward (in whose hands though their liues laie to be disposed as
he list, yet he was so far from violating the same, that he shewed himselfe a woonderfull
fauourer of their estates, and in fine not onelie put them to their reasonable ransoms, but
restored them to their roialties, from the which their sinister lot had deposed them) Christopher

prince of Wales married the countesse of Kent, which before was wife vnto the lord
Thomas Holland: and before that, she was also wife vnto the erle of Salisburie, and
diuorsed from him, and wedded to the same lord Holland. She was daughter vnto Edmund
earle of Kent, brother to king Edward the second, that was beheaded in the beginning
of this kings reigne, as before y&eacute;e haue heard. And bicause the prince and sh&eacute;e
were within degr&eacute;es of consanguinitie forbidden to marrie, a dispensation was gotten
from the pope to remooue that let. In this yeare also was a great death of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[Pg 677]</a></span>

the which the one appeared in the southeast, and the other in the southwest, out of which
castels about the houre of noone sundrie times were s&eacute;ene hosts of armed men (as
appeared to mans sight) issuing foorth, and that host which sailed out of the castell in the

verie wet season, namelie in the summer time and haruest, so that much corne and haie

Moreouer, it was ordeined in this parlement, that no maner of person, of what

haue any purueiers of vittels, nor should take vp any thing without readie paiment, and

the which none of the noble men could obteine licence to be absent. In this parlement
all rich ornaments of gold and siluer vsed to be worne in kniues, girdels, ouches, rings, or
otherwise, to the setting foorth of the bodie, were prohibited, except to such as might
dispend ten pounds by yeare. Morouer that none should weare any rich clothes or
furres, except they might dispend an hundred pounds by yeare. &para; Moreouer it was
enacted, that labourers and husbandmen should not vse any deintie dishes, or costlie
drinks at their tables. But these, and such other acts as were deuised and established
at this parlement, tooke none effect, as after it appeared. In this yeare, there came into
England to speake with king Edward concerning their weightie affaires, thr&eacute;e kings, to
wit, the king of France, the king of Scotland, &amp; the king of Cypres: they were honorablie
receiued, and highlie feasted.</p>

<p>The king of Scotland, and the king of Cypres after they had dispatched their businesse
for the which they came, turned backe againe; but the French king fell sicke, and remained
here till he died, as in the next yeare ye shall heare. He arriued here in England,
about the latter end of this yeare, and came to Eltham (where king Edward as then laie)
on the foure and twentith day of Ianuarie, and there dined. After diner, he tooke his
horsse and rode toward London, and vpon Blacke heath, the citizens of London clad in
one kind of liuerie, and verie well horssed, met him, and conueied him from thence
through to London, to the Sauoy, where his lodging was prepared. About the beginning
of March, in this eight and thirtith yeare, the forenamed French king fell into a gr&eacute;euous
sickenesse, of the which he died the eight day of Aprill following. His corps was conueied
into France, and there buried at S. Denise: his exequies were kept here in England, in
diuerse places right solemnelie, by king Edwards appointment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Froissard.</i></div>

<p>This yeare, by reason of an extreme sore frost, continuing from the seuen and twentith
day of September last passed, vnto the beginning of Aprill, in this eight and thirtith yeare
(or rather from the seuenth day of December till the ninetenth day of March, as Walsingham
and other old writers doo report) the ground laie vntild, to the great hinderance
and losse of all growing things on the earth. This yeare on Michaelmasse day, before
the castell of Aulroy, not far distant from the citie of Vannes in Britaine, a sore battell
was fought betwixt the lord Charles de Blois, and the lord Iohn of Mountford. For
when there could be no end made betwixt these two lords, touching their title vnto the
duchie of Britaine, they renewed the wars verie hotlie in that countrie, and procured all
the aid they might from each side. The king of France sent to the aid of his cousine
Charls de Blois a thousand speares; and the earle of Mountford sent into Gascoigne,
requiring sir Iohn Chandois, and other Englishmen there to come to his succour. Sir
Iohn Chandois gladlie consented to this request, and therevpon got licence of the prince,
and came into Britaine, where he found the earle of Mountford at the siege of the foresaid
castell of Aulroy. In the meane time the lord Charles de Blois, being prouided of
men, and all things necessarie to giue battell, came and lodged fast by his enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thr&eacute;e thousand and six hundred fighting men, as <i>Walsing.</i> saith.</div>

<p>The earle of Mountford aduertised of his approch, by the aduise of sir Iohn Chandois
and other of his capteins, had chosen out a plot of ground to lodge in, and meant there to
abide their enimies. With the lord Charles of Blois was that valiant knight sir Berthram
de Cleaquin or Guesclin (as some write him) by whose aduice there were ordeined thr&eacute;e
battels, and a reregard, and in each battell were appointed a thousand of good fighting
men. On the other part, the earle of Mountford diuided his men likewise into thr&eacute;e battels
and a reregard. The first was led by sir Robert Knols, sir Walter Hewet, and sir Richard
Brulle or Burlie. The second by sir Oliuer de Clisson, sir Eustace Daubreticourt, and
sir Matthew Gournie. The third the earle of Mountford himselfe guided, and with him
was sir Iohn Chandois associat, by whom he was much ruled: for the king of England,
whose daughter the earle of Mountford should marie, had written to sir Iohn Chandois,
that he should take good h&eacute;ed to the businesse of the said earle, and order the same as
sagelie as he might deuise or imagine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The worthie actiuitie of the English archers.</div>

<p>In ech of these thr&eacute;e armies were fiue hundred armed men, and foure hundred archers.
In the reregard were appointed fiue hundred men of warre, vnder the gouernance of sir
Hugh Caluerlie. Beside sir Iohn Chandois, &amp; other Englishmen recited by Froissard,
there was the lord William Latimer, as one of the chiefe on the earle of Mountfords side.
There were not past sixt&eacute;ene hundred good fighting men on that side, as Thomas Walsingham
plainelie writeth. Now when the hosts were ordred on both sides (as before we
haue said) they approched togither, the Frenchmen came close in their order of battell,
and were to the number of fiue and twentie hundred men of armes, after the manner of
that age, beside others. Euerie man had cut his speare (as then they vsed, at what time
they should ioine in battell) to the length of fiue foot, and a short ax hanging at his side.
At the first incounter there was a sore battell, and trulie the archers shot right fiercelie,
howbeit their shot did little hurt to the Frenchmen, they were so well armed and furnished:
the archers perceiuing that (being big men and light) cast awaie their bowes,
and entered in amongst the Frenchmen that bare the axes, and plucked them out of their
hands, wherwith they fought after right hardlie. There was doone manie a noble feat of
armes, manie taken, and rescued againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Berthr&#x0101; de Cleaquin.</div>

<p>Against the earle of Montfords battell, fought the battell which the lord Charles de
Blois ruled, and at the first, the earle of Montfords part was sore oppressed, and brought
out of order in such sort, that if sir Hugh Caluerlie had not in time rel&eacute;eued them, the
losse had runne on that side, but finallie so long they fought, that all the battels assembled
and ioined each to other, except the reregard of the Englishmen, whereof (as is said) sir
Hugh Caluerlie was ch&eacute;efe. He kept alwaies his battell on a wing, and euer succoured
where he saw n&eacute;ed. At length, the Frenchmen not able to indure the valiant dooings of
their aduersaries, began to breake. First the earle of Auxerres batell was discomfited,
and put to flight, and the said earle sore wounded, and taken prisoner, but the battell of
sir Berthram de Cleaquin as yet stood manfullie at defense, howbeit at length the Englishmen
perforce opened it, and then was the said sir Berthram taken prisoner, vnder the
banner of Sir Iohn Chandois.</p>

<p>Herewith also, all the other battels of the Frenchmen and Britaines, on the part of the
lord Charles de Blois, were cleane discomfited, and put out of arraie, so that such as
resisted, and stood at defense, were slaine and beaten downe, and amongst others, the lord
Charles was there slaine himselfe, and all other either taken or slaine, except those that
escaped by flight, amongst the which there were not manie of the nobilitie. For (as
Thomas Walsingham saith) there were slaine about a thousand men of armes, and there
were taken two earles, seuen and twentie lords, and fift&eacute;ene hundred men of armes. The
chase was followed to the citie of Reimes, eight great leagues from the place where the
battell began. After this victorie, the earle of Montford conquered manie townes and
castels in Britaine, whereof the French king being aduertised, sent his brother the duke
of Aniou, vnto the wife of the lord Charles of Blois now deceassed, to comfort hir in such
an heauie case, and to take order for things as should be thought expedient, vntill further
prouision might be made.</p>

followed, and the parties were agr&eacute;ed in the moneth of Aprill next insuing. &para; This yeare
(as some haue written) king Edward finished his warres vpon S. Stephans daie, and began
the foundation of S. Stephan's chappell at Westminster in memorie thereof, which chappell
was afterwards finished by king Richard the second that succ&eacute;eded him. &para; In the nine

Angolesme, was borne the first sonne of prince Edward, and was named after his father,

<p>Also this yeare, the seuen and twentith of Iulie, Ingeram de Guines lord de Coucie, a
Frenchman, married the ladie Isabell daughter to K. Edward. The solemnization of the
marriage feast was kept at Windsor in most roiall and triumphant wise. The said lord
Coucie was created earle of Bedford, with an y&eacute;erelie annuitie of thirtie markes, going
foorth of the issues and profits of that countie, ouer and beside a thousand marks by yeare,
assigned to him and his said wife, and to the heires male of their bodies begotten, to be
paid forth of the excheker. About this time, there was a treatie also for marriage to be
had, betwixt the lord Edmund earle of Cambridge, and the ladie Margaret, daughter and
heire to the earle of Flanders, which treatie went so far, that the earle came ouer to Douer,
where the king was readie to receiue him, and there the earle promised by words of affiance,
to giue his said daughter vnto the said lord Edmund in marriage: and after that
the earle had b&eacute;ene at Douer, the space of thr&eacute;e daies, passing the time in great

<p>Whilest the king was thus at Douer with the earle of Flanders, the lord Latimer came
from the lord Iohn de Montford, to vnderstand his pleasure, touching the offers that were
made for peace, vpon whose returne with answer, the peace was concluded as before y&eacute;e

brother Henrie, which was aided in that enterprise by sir Berthram de Cleaquin latelie
deliuered, and other Frenchmen: so that the said Henrie was crowned at Burgus, vpon
Easter daie: wherefore the said Peter was constreined to fl&eacute;e, and so came to Burdeaux
to sue for aid at the hands of the prince of Wales. This yeare by the kings commandement,
a restraint was ordeined, that Peter pence should not be from thencefoorth anie
more gathered within this realme, nor anie such paiment made at Rome, which had b&eacute;ene
vsed to be paid there, euer since the daies of Ine, king of Westsaxons, which ordeined this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>

paiment was abrogated at this time by king Edward, it was after renewed againe, and the
monie gathered in certeine shires of this realme, till the daies of king Henrie the eight, so
greatlie preuailed the vsurped power of that beast of Rome, which had poisoned the

<p>In this yeare fell great abundance of raine in the time of haie haruest, so that much
corne and haie was lost. &para; There was also such fighting amongst sparrowes in that season,
that they were found dead on the ground in great numbers. Also, there followed
great mortalitie of people, the sicknesse being so sharpe and vehement, that manie being
in perfect health ouer night when they went to bed, were found dead in the morning.
Also, manie died of the small pocks, both men, women, and children. &para; Moreouer this
yeare, Simon Islep archbishop of Canturburie departed this life, and Simon Langham
bishop of Elie succ&eacute;eded in his place. This yeare at Burdeaux, was borne the second
sonne of prince Edward named Richard, on the third daie of Aprill: his godfather at the
fontstone was Iames K. of Maiorke. &para; Peter the king of Spaine, who (as y&eacute;e haue heard)
was expelled out of his realme by his bastard brother, made such earnest sute to the prince
of Wales for aid to be restored home, that finallie the prince aduertising his father king
Edward of the whole matter, by aduise from him, determined to bring home the said king
Peter, and to restore him againe to his kingdome, by force of armes, in despite of all his
aduersaries.</p>

<p>The prince ind&eacute;ed was verie desirous to take this enterprise vpon him, both of a certeine
pitifull affection to relieue the miserable state of king Peter, and also of an ardent desire
which he had to purchase a glorious fame thorough martiall d&eacute;eds, and noble acts of chiualrie.
Therfore hauing this occasion to imploie his time in such exercises, and now
commanded thereto of his father, he was exc&eacute;edinglie glad in his mind, and with all sp&eacute;ed
that might be, made his prouision both of a sufficient armie of men of warre, and also of all
other things necessarie for the furniture of such an enterprise: but first, he tooke good
assurance of king Peter, for the paiment of the soldiers wages: so the king left at Baionne
thr&eacute;e of his daughters, Beatrice, Constance, and Isabell as pledges, for performance of all
the couenants agr&eacute;ed betwixt him and the prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince setteth forward towards Spaine. He entreth into Nauarre.</div>

<p>Thus when the prince, by the aduise and counsell of sir Iohn Chandois, and sir Robert
Knols (by whome he was much ruled) had taken direction in his businesse, for that his
iournie into Spaine, in each condition as was thought behoouefull, he with the king of
Spaine in his companie, passed foorth with a puissant armie, and came to the streicts of
Ronceualle, at the entrie into Nauarre, and obteining so much fr&eacute;endship of the king of
Nauarre, as to haue the passages of his countrie opened, they entered into his realme
through the same, as fr&eacute;ends, without finding any resistance. In this meane time, Henrie
king of Spaine, hauing knowledge that the prince of Wales was thus comming against him,
to restore his brother king Peter to his former degr&eacute;e, by aduise of sir Berthram de Cleaquin,
got a great number of soldiers out of France, by whose aid he might the better defend
himselfe against his enimies.</p>

<p>Now it chanced, that whilest the prince of Wales was passing thorough Nauarre, toward
the entrie of Spaine, certeine of those Frenchmen, vnder the leading of sir Oliuer Mannie,
tooke the king of Nauarre prisoner, as he was riding from one towne to an other. Manie
maruelled at that chance, and some there were that thought he suffered himselfe to be taken
for a cautele, bicause he would not aid the prince of Wales any further, nor conduct him
through his realme, as he had promised to doo. But the prince nothing dismaid herewith,
passed forward, by the guiding of a knight of Nauarre, called sir Martin de Care, and
finallie came to the confines of Spaine, and lodged at Victoria, not far from his enimies.
For king Henrie of Spaine, vnderstanding which waie the prince drew, came forward to
incounter him, and pight downe his field, not far from the borders of his realme, at a place
called saint Muchaule: and thus were both the hosts lodged within a small distance the
one against the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king of Spaine sendeth to the prince.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Victoria. Viana.</div>

<p>King Henrie had sent to the prince an herauld of armes with a letter, requiring to know
of him for what cause he moued warre against him, sith he had neuer offended him. The
prince taking deliberation for answer of this letter, kept the messenger with him, and
perceiuing that king Henrie came not forward, but laie still at saint Muchaule, stronglie
incamped, he remooued from Victoria, and came to a towne called Viana, where he staied
two daies to refresh his people, and after went forward, and passed the riuer which diuideth
the realmes of Castile and Nauarre, at the bridge of Groigne. King Henrie aduertised
hereof, departed from saint Muchaule, and came before the towne of Nauarret, situat on
the same riuer. Not manie daies before the prince passed the riuer at Groigne, king
Henrie had sent foorth two of his brethren, the earle Dom Teille, and the lord Sanches,
with six hundred horssemen, to view the princes host.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir William Felton slaine.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Froissard.</i></div>

<p>They chanced to incounter two hundred English horssemen, whom after long and
sharpe fight they distressed, &amp; slue sir William Felton, one of the chiefe leaders of those
Englishmen, and tooke sir Thomas Felton his brother, sir Hugh Hastings, and diuerse
other, both knights and esquiers. Whether that king Henrie was greatlie incouraged by
this good lucke in the beginning, or that he trusted through the great multitude of his
people, which he had there with him, to haue the vpper hand of his enimies, true it is,
that he coueted sore to giue them battell; and although he might haue wearied the prince,
and constreined him for want of vittels to haue returned, or to haue fought with him
at some great aduantage, if he had deferred the battell, as the marshall of France Dandrehen
gaue counsell, yet he would n&eacute;eds fight in all the hast, and therefore did thus approch
his enimies.</p>

<p>The prince perceiuing that his aduersarie came forward to incounter him, dispatched
the herauld with an answer to the letter which he had of him receiued, containing in effect,
that for great considerations, he had taken vpon him to aid the rightfull K. of Spaine,
chased out of his realm by violent wrong, and that if it might be, he would gladlie make an
agr&eacute;ement betwixt them; conditionallie, that king Henrie of necessitie must then forsake
the administration, and all the title of the kingdome of Spaine, which by no rightfull meane
he could inioy, and therefore if he refused thus to doo, he was for his part resolued how
to proc&eacute;ed. The herauld departed with this answer, and came therewith vnto king Henrie,
and deliuered it vnto him, as then lodged with his puissant armie at Nauarre, so that then
both parties prepared themselues to battell.</p>

<p>The prince hauing with him thirtie thousand men of Englishmen, Gascoignes, and other

and with him was sir Iohn Chandois constable of Guien, sir William Beauchampe son to
the earle of Warwike, the lord Dalbret, sir Richard Dangle, and sir Stephan Coosenton,
marshals of Guien, &amp; diuerse other. The middle ward was gouerned by the prince, and
with him was the foresaid Peter king of Spaine, and diuerse other lords and knights of
England, Poictou, and other countries, as the vicounts of Chatelareault and Rochcort,
the lords of Partnie, Pinan, Taneboton, and others, sir Richard Pontchardon, sir Thomas

<p>On the second day of Aprill, the prince with his battell thus ordered, remoued from
Groigne, and marching that day two leagues forward, came before Nauarret, and there
tooke his lodging, within a small distance from his enemies, so that both parties prepared
to giue battell the next day in the morning, commanding that euerie man at the sounding
of the first trumpet, should apparell themselues, that they might be readie vpon the next
sound to be set in order of battell, and to go against their enemies. The Spaniards very
earlie in the morning drew into the field, and ordeined thr&eacute;e battels in this wise. The
first was led by sir Berthram de Cleaquin, wherein were all the Frenchmen and other
strangers, to the number of foure thousand knights and esquires, well armed and appointed,
after the manner of France. In the second battell was the earle Dom Tielle,
with his brother the lord Sanches, hauing with them fift&eacute;ene thousand men on foot, and
on horssebacke. The third battell and the greatest of all was gouerned by king Henrie
himselfe, hauing in that battell seuen thousand horssemen, and thr&eacute;escore thousand footmen,
with crossebowes, darts, speares, lances, and other abillements of war: so in all
thr&eacute;e battels he had fourescore and six thousand men on horssebacke and on foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Lancaster.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The capitall of Beuf.</div>

<p>The prince of Wales, at the breaking of the daie was readie in the field with his people

hosting pace; and as they passed a little hill, they might s&eacute;e as they were descending
downe the same, their enemies comming likewise towards them, in good order of battell.
When they were approached n&eacute;ere togither, and readie to ioine, the duke of Lancasters
battell incountered with the battell of sir Berthram de Cleaquin, which two battels verie
eagerlie assailed each other so that there was betwixt them a sore conflict, and well continued.
The erle Dom Teille, and his brother the lord Sanches, upon the first approach
of the princes battell towards them, fled out of the field, and with them two thousand
speares, so that the residue of their battell were shortlie after discomfited, for the capitall
of Buz otherwise Beuf, and the lord Clisson, came vpon them on foot, and slue and
hurt manie of them, so that they brake their arraie, and fled to saue themselues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The archers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">King Peter.</div>

<p>This chance discomforted the hearts of the Spaniards right sore, but yet king Henrie
like a valiant gentleman came forward, and incouraged his men all that he might, so that
there was a cruell battell, and well foughten a long time. For the Spaniards with slings
cast stones in such fierce manner, that they claue therewith manie an helmet and bassenet,
hurt manie, and ouerthrew them to the earth. On the other part, the English
archers shot freshlie at their enemies, galled and slue the Spaniards, and brought them
to great confusion: yet king Henrie nothing abashed herewith, wheresoeuer he perceiued
his men to shrinke, thither he resorted, calling upon them, and exhorting them
to remember their estimations and duties, so that by his diligence and manfull incouragement,
thrise that daie did he staie his people, being at point to giue ouer; and set
them in the faces of his enemies againe. Neither did the souldiers alone manfullie behaue
themselues, but the capteins also stoutlie laid about them. King Peter like a lion
pressed forward, coueting to m&eacute;et with his brother Henrie, that he might s&eacute;eke his reuenge
on him with his owne hands. Cruell was the fight, and tried throughlie with most
eger and fierce minds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spaniards put to flight.</div>

<p>At length, when the Spaniards were no longer able to susteine the force and violence
of the Englishmen, Gascoignes, &amp; other which were there against them, they brake
their arraie, and fled; so that neither the authoritie nor bold exhortation of king
Henrie, could cause them to tarrie anie longer: wherevpon, when he saw himselfe forsaken
of his people, and that few abode with him to resist his enemies, he also to saue
himselfe fled out of the field, being fullie persuaded, that if he had b&eacute;ene taken, no
ransome should haue saued his life. The battell that was best fought, and longest held
togither, was that of the strangers, which sir Berthram de Cleuquin led. For if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>
Spaniards had doone halfe their parts as well as the Frenchmen, &amp; other in this battell,
the matter had gone harder against the Englishmen than it did: yet finally, by the noble
courage of the duke of Lancaster, and the valiant prowesse of sir John Chandois, sir
Hugh Caluerlie, &amp; others, the Frenchmen were put to flight, and their battell quite discomfited.
The slaughter in this battell was great, both of them that were slaine in the
field, and of those that were drowned in the riuer that runneth by the towne of
Nauarret.</p>

<p>After that the battell was ended, and that such as had followed the chase were returned,
the prince caused the fields to be searched, to vnderstand what number had
b&eacute;ene slaine in the battell: they that were appointed to take the view, vpon their returne
reported, that there was dead of men of armes five hundred and thr&eacute;escore, and
of commons about seauen thousand, and five hundred of the English part: there were
slaine of men of name, but foure knights, two Gascoignes, one Almaine, and the fourth
an Englishman, and of other meane souldiers, not past fortie (as Froissard saith). But
others affirme, that there were slaine of the princes part about sixt&eacute;ene hundred; which
should s&eacute;eme to be more like a truth, if the battell was fought so sore and fiercelie, as
Froissard himselfe dooth make report. Howbeit, there be that write, how the duke of
Lancaster wan the field by great fortune and valiancie, yet the prince came n&eacute;ere to his
enimies. But howsoeuer it was, the Englishmen obtained the victorie in this battell,
fought on a saturdaie being the third of Aprill, in the yeare 1367. There were taken
prisoners, to the number of two thousand, and amongst them the erle of Dene, sir Berthram
de Cleaquin, the marshall Dandrehen or Odenhen, and manie other men of name.</p>

<p>After the battell, king Peter went to Burgus, and was receiued into the citie, and
shortlie after, that is to say, on the Wednesdaie folowing, the prince came thither, and
there held his Easter with king Peter, and tarried there aboue thr&eacute;e w&eacute;ekes. In the
mean time, they of Asturgus, Toledo, Lisbone, Cordoua, Galice, Siuill, and of all
other places of the kingdome of Spaine, came in, and homage vnto king Peter, promising
him to be true to him euer after: for they saw that resistance would not auaile so
long as the prince should be in the countrie. After this, the prince was in hand with
king Peter, for the souldiers wages, by whose aid he was thus restored into his former
estate. King Peter went vnto Siuill, to makeshift for monie accordinglie, promising to
returne againe, within a few w&eacute;ekes, and to s&eacute;e euerie man paid, according as he had
couenanted. For when he was driuen out of his realme, and came to Burdeaux to
craue aid of the prince, he promised, that so soone as he should be restored to
his kingdome, he would s&eacute;e the souldiers contented of their wages, and bound
himselfe thereto, both by his oth and writing giuen vnder his seale. But when he
obteined his purpose, he forgat all fr&eacute;endlie dutie, and was so farre from performing
his promise, that he cloaked his ill meaning with a feigned tale, and sent the prince
a message spiced with hypocrisie and vnthankfulnesse, two foule faults in a priuat
man, much more odious in a prince and great state, as the poet wiselie and trulie saith
in this distichon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">King Peters dissimulation.</div>

<p>The prince tarried for the returne of king Peter, both w&eacute;ekes and moneths, but could
not heare anie tidings of him. He therefore sent vnto him, to vnderstand the cause of
the staie: his answer was, that he had prouided monie, and sent it by certeine of his
men toward the prince, but the companions that serued vnder the prince, had met with
it by the way, and taken it from them that had the conueiance of it: he therefore required
the prince to rid the realme of those snaphances, and to leaue behind him some of his
officers, to whome in name of him he would make paiment of such monie as was due.
This answer pleased not the prince, but there was no remedie, for other at that present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>
he could not haue, for anie likeliehood he saw: and therefore, taking order with king
Peter how the paiment should be made, he prepared to returne into Gascoigne. The
order therefore taken betwixt them, was this. Within foure moneths next insuing, king
Peter should paie the one halfe of the wages due to the soldiers for this iournie, vnto
such as the prince should leaue behind him to receiue the same, and the other halfe
within one yeare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince put to his shifts for default of paie.</div>

<p>The prince was compelled to breake his plate, and to make monie thereof to paie his
soldiers, namelie, the companions, which he had called forth of France, so that he left
himselfe bare of all riches, to k&eacute;epe touch with them, although king Dampeter failed in
his promise each waie foorth. For where the prince should haue had in recompense
towards his charges, the countie of Algezara, and other lands, by the said Dampeters
assignment, so that he sent one of his knights to take seizine of the same lands, he was
neuertheles disappointed, for he could not come by any peaceable possession of those
lands, and so returned greatlie impouerished, hauing spent in this iournie all that he
could make. In the meane time the bastard Henrie, hauing escaped out of the field by
flight, got him into France, and there through fauor of the duke of Aniou, so purchased
for himselfe, that he got togither a certeine number of Britains and other soldiers, &amp;
comming to the frontiers of the princes land in Gascoigne, got a towne in Bigore, called
Bannieres, and made war upon the princes subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The prince of Wales constreined to burden his subiects with a sore subsidie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Coine not to be inhanced nor abased.</div>

<p>Ye haue heard how the Prince of Wales could get no monie of the king of Spaine,
for the wages of his men of warre, which he had reteined to serue him in the reducing
the said king home into his countrie, wherefore the prince hauing b&eacute;ene at great charges
in that iournie, was neither able to satisfie them, nor mainteine his owne estate, without
some great aid of his subiects, and therefore he was counselled to raise a subsidie called
a fuage, through all the countrie of Aquitaine, to run onelie for the space of fiue yeares.
To this paiment, euerie chimnie or fire must haue b&eacute;ene contributorie, paieng yearely
one franke, the rich to haue borne out the poore. And to haue this paiment granted,
all the states of the countrie were called togither at Niort. The Poictouins, and they of
Xainctonge, Limosin, Rouergne, and of Rochell, agr&eacute;ed to the princes request, with
condition, that he should k&eacute;epe the course of his coine stable, for the terme of seuen

Pincornet, and diuerse other great barons: but yet to depart quietlie from the assemblie,
they required a time to take better aduise, and so they repairing into their countries, determined
neither to returne againe according to their promises, nor to suffer any fuage

sought occasion forthwith to reuolt from the English obeisance and submission, knowing

<p>And therefore diuerse lords of them went to the French king, and there exhibited into
the chamber of the p&eacute;eres of France, their complaints of the grieuous impositions &amp;
wrongs, which the prince went about to laie vpon them, affirming that their resort ought
of speciall duty to be to the crowne of France, and to the king there, as to their lord
Peramount. The French king, who would not s&eacute;eme to breake the peace betw&eacute;ene him
and the king of England, dissembled the matter, and told them that he would peruse the
tenor of the charters and letters of the peace, and so far foorth as he might by permission
of the same, he would be glad to doo them good. The earles of Arminake, Perigourd,
Gominges, and the lord Dalbret, with other that were come thither about this matter,
were contented with this answer, and so staied in France, till they might vnderstand
further, both of the French kings mind, and of the princes dooings. &para; This y&eacute;ere in

<p>These letters were giuen to a knight and a clerke, to beare and present to the prince,
which according to that they had in charge, went to Burdeaux, and there getting licence
to come before his presence, they read the letters, wherewith he was not a little chafed, and
openlie told them for a plaine answer, that he meant to accomplish the French kings
request, for his comming to Paris, but that should be with his helmet on his head, and
thr&eacute;escore thousand armed men, to beare witnesse of his appearance. The messengers
perceiuing the prince to be sore offended with their message, got them awaie, without

he sent with the appeale, by such of the messengers seruants as were returned, and declared
how their maisters were delt with, he couertlie prepared for the warre. The lord
Iohn Chandois, and other of the princes counsell foresaw what would insue of leauieng
the fuage, and therefore counselled the prince, not to proc&eacute;ed any further in it. But he
hauing onlie regard to the rel&eacute;efe of his souldiers and men of warre, would n&eacute;eds go
forward with it. &para; Ind&eacute;ed, if he might haue brought it to passe, as it was denied, that
euerie housholder should haue paid a franke for chimniage, the summe would haue

was vpon a time appointed to wait at the table, where his father and the king of England
sat togither at meat. And bicause a noble man of England that was appointed likewise
to attend at the same table, serued first the king of England before the king of France,
this Philip vp with his fist, and tooke the English lord a blow on the eare, saieng:

his high court of parlement holden at Paris, proc&eacute;eded in iudgement vpon the appellation

<p>At the selfe same time that the defiance was made to the king here in England, the earle
of S. Paule, and Guie de Chatillon master of the crosbowes in France, entered into the
countie of Ponthieu, tooke Abuile, and an English knight called sir Nicholas Louaigne
seneshall of that countrie vnder the king of England, as then being within it. They
tooke also saint Valerie, Crotoie, Rue, Pont saint Renie, and to be short, reduced the
whole countrie of Ponthieu vnder the French obeisance, which had remained in possession
of the Englishmen for the space of a hundred and twelue yeares, euer since Edward
the first had the same assigned to him in name of a dowrie, with his wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor,
sister to Alfonse K. of Castile. And yet were the people of that countrie readie now to
reuolt to the French dominion, not withstanding their former long continued obeisance
to the Englishmen: for otherwise could not the Frenchmen so easilie haue come to their
purpose, but that the people were couenanted before to receiue them, and betraie those
few Englishmen that were amongst them.</p>

<p>About the same time also, it fell so ill for the Englishmen, that the prince of Wales
was troubled with a sore sickenesse, that had continued long with him, euer since his being
in Spaine, by reason whereof his enimies were the more bold to make attempts against
him, and dailie went about to allure and intise his subiects of the marches of Guien to
reuolt from him, in somuch that the citie of Cahors, and diuerse other townes thereabout
turned to the French part. Thus was the peace which had b&eacute;ene so suerlie made, and
with so manie solemne oths confirmed, violated and broken, and the parties fallen togither
by the eares againe in sundrie places, and namelie in Aquitaine, where sundrie armies
were abroad in the fields, diuers sieges laid, manie townes taken, often incounters and
skirmishes made, sometime to the losse of the one part, and sometime of the other, and
the countries in the meane time harried and spoiled, that maruill it is to consider, and
too long a processe it should be to rehearse the tenth part of such chances as dailie
happened amongst them, so that it might well haue b&eacute;ene said of that sore &amp; tumultuous
time:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burdille wonne.</div>

<p>King Edward sent ouer into Gascoigne the earls of Cambridge and Penbroke, with a
certeine number of men of armes and archers, the which arriuing in Britaine, passed
through that countrie by licence of the Duke, and came to the prince as then lieng at
Angolesme in Poictou, by whom they were sent to ouerrun the earle of Perigords lands,
and so they did, and after laid siege to Burdille, hauing with them about thr&eacute;e thousand
men one and other. There came with them foorth of England foure hundred men of
armes, foure hundred archers, and (as Froissard saith) beside their capteins, these earles
which he nameth, to wit, the lord of Tabestone (or rather Bradstone as I take it) sir
Brian Stapleton, sir Thomas Balaster, and sir Iohn Triuet: Whilest the said earles
went thus to make warre against the earle of Perigord, sir Hugh Caluerlie with two
thousand men of warre was sent also to ouerrun the lands of the earle of Arminacke, and of
the lord Dalbret; sir Iohn Chandois laie in the marches of Tholouse at Mountaubon, &amp;
afterwards besieged Terrieres, and in the end wan it; and so likewise did the earles of
Cambridge and Penbroke win Burdille, by reason of a saillie that they within made
foorth, and passed so far from their fortresse, that the Englishmen got betwixt them and
home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Robert Knols.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ba. Gerard.</i></div>

<p>Sir Robert Knols came from such lands as he had in Britaine, to serue the prince
now in these warres of Gascoigne, and was by him made ch&eacute;efe gouernor of all his men
of warre, who bare himselfe right worthilie in that charge. The first iournie which he
made at that time, was into Quercie, hauing with him beside his owne bands, certeine
knights of the princes retinue, as sir Richard Ponchardon, sir Stephan Gousenton, sir
Noell Loring, sir Hugh Hastings, sir Iohn Triuet, sir Thomas Spenser, sir Thomas Balaster,
sir Nicholas Bond, sir William le Moine seneschall of Aigenois, sir Baldwin de
Freuille, and others. At their comming into Quercie, they besieged a strong fortresse
called Durmell, within the which were diuerse capteins of the companions, as Aimon
d'Ortigo, the little Mechin, Iaques de Bray, Perot de Sauoie, and Arnaudon de Pons,
the which so valiantlie defended the place, that although the lord Chandois, accompanied
with sir Thomas Felton, the capitall of Beuf, sir Iohn de Pommiers, sir Thomas
Percie, sir Eustace Daubreticourt, and others came with their retinues from Montaubon,
to r&eacute;enforce that siege, yet could they not obteine their purpose, but raising from thence
after fiue w&eacute;ekes siege (constreined thereto through want of vittels) they marched streight
to a towne called Domme, which they besieged, hauing in their armie fift&eacute;ene hundred
men at armes, beside two thousand archers and brigands, so called in those daies, of
an armor which they ware named brigandines, vsed then by footmen, that bare also targets,
or pauoises, and certeine darts or iauelines to throw at their enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aquitaine full of warre.</div>

<p>The towne and castell of Domme were so strong of themselues, and so well prouided
of men of warre that were appointed to the gard of the same, with the lord thereof called
sir Robert de Domme, that after the English capteins perceiued they should but lose time
to linger about the winning of that towne, they raised their siege, and marching further
into the countrie, wan Gauaches Freins, Rochmador, and Ville Franche, vpon the
marches of Toulouzain, greatlie to the displeasure of the duke of Aniou that lay at the
same time in the citie of Toulouze, &amp; could not remedie the matter. &para; But to recite
euerie particular enterprise, as the same was atchiued by the English capteins and men
of warre in that season, it should be more than the purpose of this volume might permit,
and therefore I passe ouer diuerse things, which I find registred by Froissard and other
writers, onelie aduertising you, that as the Englishmen thus made sore warres against
their aduersaries abroad in those quarters: so the Frenchmen on the other part had assembled
great numbers of men of warre, not onelie to defend their frontiers, but also by
inuasions to win from the Englishmen towns and castels, and to wast such countries as
would not turne to their side. Thus were all those countries in troubles of warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Bauier.</div>

<p>The two kings also of England and France, signified to their neighbours the causes of
this warre, laieng the fault either to other, and excusing themselues as cleare and innocent
therein. Edward duke of Gelderland, nephue to the king of England, as sonne to his
sister, and the duke of Gulike cousine to the kings children by their mother that was
daughter to the earle of Heinault, tooke great despite that the French king had broken the
peace, as they were throughlie persuaded, and that he had defied king Edward (as before
y&eacute;e haue heard.) Wherevpon they sent their defiance vnto the French king, threatning
to be reuenged on him to the vttermost of their powers. Duke Albert of Bauier, was
once minded also to haue aided king Edward in this warre: but afterwards such persuasions
were vsed on the French kings part, that he chose to remaine as neuter betwixt
them both, refusing to take anie part.</p>

<p>Among the soldiers also called companions, which serued the prince in this season,
there were thr&eacute;e capteins, right hardie and verie expert men of warre, Ortigo, Bernard
de Wiske, &amp; Bernard de la Sale. These thr&eacute;e remaining as then in Limosin, hearing
that the duke of Burbons mother, which was also mother to the French qu&eacute;ene, laie
within the castell of Belleperch in Burbonnois, with a small companie about hir, rode
thither in one daie and a night, so that in the morning they approched the castell, scaled
it, and tooke it, with the ladie within it. And though they were after besieged in the same
castell by the duke of Burbon and other Frenchmen, yet they defended it, till the earls
of Cambridge and Penbroke, with fift&eacute;ene hundred speares, and thr&eacute;e thousand of other
men of warre, came and offered the Frenchmen battell, lodging afore them fift&eacute;ene daies.
And when they perceiued that the Frenchmen would not issue out of the bastide (in which
they laie) to giue battell, the earles of Cambridge and Penbroke caused all them within
the castell to come foorth, and to bring with them the duches of Burbon, whome they
led awaie in sight of hir sonne, leauing the castell void and fr&eacute;e for him to enioy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French king prepareth a nauie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Lancaster set into France with an armie.</div>

<p>The French king prouided a great number of ships to assemble togither at Harflew,
and leuied a great power of men, minding to bestow them aboord in the same ships, that
they might saile into England, and make warre against king Edward in his owne countrie.
Ch&eacute;efteine of this armie should haue b&eacute;ene his brother the duke of Burbon, but this
iournie was broken, for the Frenchmen were eased of the paine to come to s&eacute;eke the
Englishmen at home in England, they comming ouer into France, and proffering them
battell euen at their owne doores. For the king of England hauing leuied a power of
archers, and other men of warre, sent them ouer vnder the leading of his sonne the duke
of Lancaster. There went with him in this iournie, the earles of Hereford and Salisburie,
the lord Ros, the lord Basset, the lord Willoughbie, the lord de la Ware, the lord
de la Pole, the lord Walter of Mannie, the lord Henrie Percie, the lord Thomas Grantson,
sir Alane Burhul, sir Richard Sturrie, &amp; diuerse other. They went ouer about
Midsummer. And after they had rested a little, the duke set forward and roded foorth
into the countrie, spoiling and harrieng the same, and when he saw time, returned againe
to Calis.</p>

<p>The French king being at Roan, heard of the arriual of this armie at Calis, and that his
countrie of Picardie was in great danger: he changed his purpose therefore of sending
an armie into England, and with all sp&eacute;ed appointed that his power should with his brother
the duke of Burgognie turne toward Calis, to resist the duke of Lancaster. Herevpon
when the duke of Lancaster heard that the duke of Burgognie was thus comming
toward him, he issued foorth of Calis, and comming into the vallie beneath the hill of
Turneham, there tooke his field, and fortified the place with strong hedges and rampiers,
the better to be able to resist his enimies if they would assaile him. The duke of Burgognie
came still forward, till he approched verie n&eacute;ere to the duke of Lancasters campe,
and pight downe his field aloft vpon the hill of Turneham, so that the fronts of both hosts
were within lesse than a mile either of other.</p>

<p>There was come to the duke of Lancaster a knight of the marches of Almaine, called
sir Robert de Namur with an hundred speares: but yet the duke of Lancasters host was
but one handfull of men, in respect of the huge number of the French armie, wherin
were (as Froissard writeth) foure thousand knights beside others. But yet for all his
great puissance and number of men, he would not aduenture to assaile the Englishmen
in their lodgings, as it was thought he would haue doone, but kept himselfe and his men
vpon the hill, from the foure and twentith of August, vnto the twelfth of September, and
then dislodged not much to his honour, howsoeuer writers doo excuse it, declaring how
his brother had giuen him streight commandement, that in no wise he should fight with
the Englishmen: and that when he had sent to his brother for commission either to fight,
or to remooue, he was commanded to turne with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Paris, and to breake
vp his armie for that time. Some there be that write, how that after both these hostes
had lien the one against the other a long space, to the reproofe of both chiefteins, it
chanced that the lord Thomas Beauchampe earle of Warwike came thitherward by sea, to
be at the battell, which he heard would shortlie follow betw&eacute;ene the two armies: but yer
he was come to land, the Frenchmen for feare durst no longer abide, but secretlie in the
night departed and fled towards Hesdin, and so to Paris, for the which their flight, the
duke of Burgognie was after blamed of his brother the French king.</p>

of the French armie beside the hill of Turneham, the said duke returned to Calis,
and there refreshed himselfe and his people the space of thr&eacute;e daies. And then he set
forward againe, &amp; with him as marshals of the host, was the earle of Warwike, and the
lord Roger Beauchampe, with the lords and knights before remembred. They tooke
their iournie to S. Omers, and by Turwin, and then through the countie of saint Paule,
still burning the countrie as they went. They rode not past thr&eacute;e or foure leages in a
daie, and k&eacute;eping on their waie, they came by saint Riquier, and at the planches vnder
Abuile passed the riuer of Some, and then entered into the countrie of Vimew, in purpose
to go vnto Harflew, and there to burne the French kings nauie. Thus passing forward
thorough Vimew, and the countie of Ewe, they entered into the archbishoprike of
Roan, and marching foorth by D&eacute;epe, came vnto Harflew: but the earle of saint Poule,
and the lord of Fiennes constable of France which had coasted the English armie in all
this iournie, with a great power of men, was gotten before them, and entred into this
towne, so that they knew how they should but lose their paine, if they did assaile it, and
so therefore after they had lien before it thr&eacute;e daies, on the fourth day they dislodged,
&amp; went backe againe towards Calis, returning through the countrie of Ponthieu, and
before Abuile chanced to incounter a number of Frenchmen, which gaue to the duke
battell. In the which was taken sir Hugh de Chatellon, master of the crosbowes of
France, with other knights, esquiers, and burgesses of that towne, and about sixt&eacute;ene score

of the towne, with not past ten or twelue with him, to s&eacute;e how the passage of Rowraie was
kept by them that had charge thereof. How soeuer it came to passe, taken he was, &amp;
brought to the duke of Lancaster, that reioised greatlie of that good hap: and so marching
forward, he passed the riuer at Blanchetaque, and drew towards the towne of Rew
on the seaside, and so to Montreuill, and finallie to Calis. Then were the strangers
licenced to depart: and bicause it was far in the winter, as about saint Martines tide, the
duke and the most part of his armie returned into England. In this yeare chanced the
third mortalitie, which was exc&eacute;eding great both of men and beasts, that the like had
not b&eacute;ene heard of. And amongst other people that perished of that pestilentiall sickenesse,
that worthie knight and noble capteine the earle of Warwike died at Calis in the
moneth of Ianuarie, after his returne from Harflew. &para; The countrie of Aquitaine was
full of trouble in this meane time, either part s&eacute;eking to grieue other to the vttermost of
their powers. &para; Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke, hauing with him certeine bands of
men of warre, recouered diuerse towns and castels in those parts: but when he perceiued
how the enimies that were not far from the place where he was lodged, shewed manifest
tokens of feare, in marching one while vncerteinelie forward, and an other while
fetching great compasses about, he somewhat vnwarilie setting vpon them in their campe,
was discomfited and put to flight, so that getting him into a place of the Templers, that
was closed about with a wall, he remained there in great danger to be taken prisoner of
his enemies that assailed him, if the lord Iohn Chandois seneschall of Poictou had not
come to the rescue, and pledged him foorth.</p>

after spake word, not liuing past a day and a night after he was hurt. The death of this
right famous, wise, and valiant knight, was bewailed as well of the Frenchmen as Englishmen.
The French king himselfe, when he heard that he was slaine, greatlie lamented
the mishap, affirming that now he being dead, there was not any left aliue able to agr&eacute;e

<p>This yeare, after that the king had gotten togither a great summe of monie, as well by
borowing of the clergie as of the laitie, he leuied an armie, &amp; sent the same ouer to
Calis about Midsummer, vnder the gouernance of that worthie ch&eacute;efteine sir Robert
Knolles, accompanied with the L. Fitz Walter, the lord Granson, sir Alaine Buxhull, sir
Iohn Bourchier, sir William Meuille, sir Geffrey Wourseley, and diuerse other noblemen,
knights, and worthie capteins. About the same time, the king of England concluded an
abstinence of warre with the Scots for the tearme of nine yeares, yet so that the Scots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[Pg 694]</a></span>
might arme themselues, and at their pleasure serue and take wages, either of the English
or French, by reason whereof, sir Robert Knolles had in his companie an hundred speares

<p>When this armie had lien and rested in Calis about the space of seauen daies, sir Robert
Knolles caused euerie man to depart the towne, and to take the fields, marching the first
daie n&eacute;ere to the castell of Fiennes, and there lodged for that night. The whole number
of this armie was not aboue twelue thousand men. Froissard saith, they were but fift&eacute;ene
hundred speares, &amp; foure thousand archers. Within the castell of Fiennes was the constable
of France, that was lord thereof, with such a number of souldiers and men of warre,
that the Englishmen thought they should but lose their labour to assaile it. And so they
passed foorth by Turrouane, and toward Arras, riding not past foure leages a daie, bicause
of their cariages and footmen. They tooke their lodging euer about noone, and laie n&eacute;ere
vnto great villages.</p>

<p>The French king had furnished all his townes and fortresses in Picardie with strong garrisons
of souldiers, to defend the same against all chances that might happen either by
siege or sudden assault. The Englishmen therefore thought not good to linger about the
winning of anie of the strong townes, but passed by them, wasting or ransoming the countries.
At Arras they shewed themselues before the barriers, and when none would issue to
skirmish with them, they set fier on the suburbs, &amp; departed. From thence they tooke the
waie by Baupalmes, and so came into Vermendois, and burnt the towne of Roy. Then
went they to Han in Vermendois, into the which all the people of the countrie were withdrawne,
with such goods as they might carie with them. And in like manner had those
doone which inhabited about S. Quintine, Peronne, and other strong townes, so
that the Englishmen found little abroad, sauing the barnes full of corne for it was after
haruest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Englishmen before Paris.</div>

<p>Thus they rode faire and easilie, two or thr&eacute;e leages a daie, and sometime to recouer

the countrie from burning and destruction, for such a summe as they agr&eacute;ed vpon, by
which meanes sir Robert Knolles got in that voiage aboue the summe of an hundred
thousand frankes. For the which he was after accused to the king of England, as one
that had not dealt iustlie in so dooing. In this sort passing the countrie, they came before
Noion, and after they had rested a while afore the towne, they went foorth wasting and
burning the countrie, and finallie passed the riuer of Marne, and so entered in Champaigne,
and passed the riuer of Aube, and also diuerse times they passed to and fro ouer the riuer
of Saine: at length drawing toward Paris, and comming before that citie, they lodged
there in the field a day and two nights, and shewed themselues in order of battell before the
citie. This was on the twentie fourth daie of September.</p>

<p>The French king was at the same time within the citie, &amp; might behold out of his lodging
of S. Paule, the fiers and smokes that were made in Gastenois, through burning the
townes and villages there by the Englishmen, but yet he would suffer none of his people
to go foorth of the citie, although there was a great power of men of warre within the citie,
both of such as had coasted the English armie in all this iournie, and also of other which
were come thither by the kings commandement, beside the burgesses, and inhabitants of
the citie. When sir Robert Knolles perceiued that he should haue no battell, he departed
and drew toward Aniou, where they wan by strength the townes of Vaas and Ruellie.
But now in the beginning of winter, there fell such discord amongst the English capteins,
through couetousnesse and enuie, that finallie they diuided themselues in sunder, greatlie
to the displeasure of sir Robert Knolles their generall, who could not rule them.</p>

but yet, although this was most true, his aduise could not be heard, nor the authoritie appointed

<p>In this meane time that sir Robert Knols made this voiage through the realme of France,
the prince of Wales laid siege to the citie of Limoges, which was reuolted to the Frenchmen.
There were with him at the laieng of this siege, his brethren, the duke of Lancaster,
and the earle of Cambridge, sir Guichard Dangle, sir Lois de Harecourt, the lord of Pons,
the lord of Partenaie, the lord of Pinane, the lord of Tannaibouton, sir Perciuall de Coulongne,

the lord de Chaumount, the lord de Longueren, sir Amerie de Tharse, the lords of
Pommiers, Mucident de l'Esparre, the Souldich de Lestrade, the lord of Gerond, and

sir Baldwin Freuille, sir Simon Burlie, sir Dangousse, sir Iohn Deuereux, sir William

<p>The prince being thus accompanied, with these worthie capteins and men of armes, to

be vndermined, and quite reuersed into the ditch, &amp; then giuing assault, entered by the
breach, and made an huge slaughter of them within, in somuch that of men, women, and
children (for none were spared in respect of age or sex) there were slaine and beheaded
that daie aboue thr&eacute;e thousand. The bishop with certeine knights and capteins were taken
and had their liues granted, though the bishop was in great danger to haue lost his head,
bicause he was a ch&eacute;efe dooer in y&eacute;elding the citie before vnto the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Moreouer in this 44 yeare of king Edward, the king of Nauarre came ouer into England,
and at Claringdon found the king, and there talked with him of such matters as they
had to conclude betwixt them two. But for that the king of Nauarre could not assure the
king of such couenants as should haue passed betwixt them two, it was not thought m&eacute;et
by the kings councell to worke too far vpon his bare word, that had before time shewed
apparant proofes of his inconstant dealing. And suerlie this doubt arose not without
cause, as his dooings shortlie after declared: for although he s&eacute;emed now at this present
to be a verie enimie to the French king, yet shortlie after he was reconciled to him againe,
and became his great fr&eacute;end for the time it lasted. This yeare in the moneth of Februarie
was a parlement called, in the which there was demanded of the spiritualtie a subsidie of
fiftie thousand pounds, and as much of the laitie. The temporall men soone agr&eacute;ed to
that paiment, but the cleargie excused themselues with faire words and shifting answers:
in somuch that the king tooke displesure with them, and deposed certeine spirituall men

<p>The bishop of Winchester, and the bishop of Beauuois being both cardinals, were put

France for a peace. But albeit they did their indeuour therein, and mooued both kings
to the vttermost of their powers, yet their motions tooke none effect, and therefore was the
warre pursued to the vttermost betwixt the parties, &amp; namelie in Aquitaine, where the fortresses
were so intermedled one with an other, some English, and some French, that one
knew not how to beware of another, nor to auoid the danger, so that the countrie of Poictou
and other the marches thereabout were in great tribulation. Sir Robert Knols, sir
Thomas Spenser, sir Iohn Triuet, and sir Hugh Hastings, diuiding their powers insunder,
went to recouer townes, some in one quarter, and some in an other, and certeine they
assaied, but preuailed not: the inhabitants doubting to be punished for their vntruths,
made such stout resistance.</p>

<p>After this, the duke of Lancaster appointed sir Robert Knols to repaire againe to Calis,

taking his iournie through France by Paris, came into the marches of Picardie: and bicause
in comparison to this man, all the English capteins were litle feared of the Frenchmen,
sir Berthram de Cleaquin, the constable of France, leauing the fortresses in the
marches of Aquitaine sufficientlie stuffed with men of warre and munition, followed sir
Robert Knols, still readie to assaile the hindermost companies, or else to set on the sides
of his enimies. So that there chanced manie skirmishes betwixt them, &amp; manie men were
slaine on both parts; but at length, when sir Robert Knols saw no likelihood to atchiue
his purposed intent in recouerie of the townes of Ponthieu, as Abuile and other, he drew
streight to Calis, and the constable retired backe into France.</p>

<p>In this 46 yeare, sir Robert Ashton was sent into Ireland as lord deputie there, and in
the same yeare, the duke of Lancaster being as then a widower, maried the ladie Constance
eldest daughter to Peter king of Spaine, which was slaine by his bastard brother Henrie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[Pg 697]</a></span>
(as before ye haue heard.) &para; Also the lord Emund earle of Cambridge maried the ladie
Isabell, sister to the same Constance. &para; Their other sister named Beatrice, affianced
to Don Ferdinando, son to Peter king of Portingale, was departed this life a little before
this time at Baionne, where they were all thr&eacute;e left as hostages by their father, when the
prince went to bring him home into his countrie (as before y&eacute;e may read.) Froissard
writeth, that the duke married the ladie Constance in Gascoigne, and that shortlie after he
returned into England with his said wife and hir sister, leauing the capitall de Bueffz, and
other lords of Gascoigne and Poictou in charge with the rule of those countries. By
reason of that marriage, the duke of Lancaster, as in right of his wife being the elder
sister, caused himselfe to be intituled king of Castile, and his said wife qu&eacute;ene of the
same realme.</p>

<p>The earle of Hereford being sent to the sea, with certeine ships of warre, was incountered
by the Flemish fl&eacute;et, before an hauen in Britaine called the Baie, where was fought
a sore battell, and long continued for the space of thr&eacute;e houres: howbeit finallie the
victorie abode with the Englishmen, notwithstanding that the Flemings were more in
number, and better prouided for the matter. There were taken of them fiue and twentie
ships, with their Admerall Iohn Peterson. They had b&eacute;ene at Rochell for wine, and
now were come to the Baie for salt vpon their returne homeward, and hearing that the
Englishmen would come that waie, staied for them, and first gaue the onset. For y&eacute;e
must remember, that by reason that the earle of Flanders had married his daughter to the
duke of Burgognie, which he had first promised to the earle of Cambridge, there was no
perfect fr&eacute;endship betwixt the realme of England, and the countries of the said earle of

<p>Sir Guichard Dangle a knight of Poictou, that was come ouer with the duke of Lancaster,
to procure the king to send some new aid into Aquitaine, was for his approoued
valiancie and tried truth to the king of England, made knight of the garter. And moreouer
at his instance the king rigged a nauie of ships, and appointed the earle of Penbroke
as generall, to saile with the same into Aquitaine, and there to remooue the siege which
the Frenchmen had laid to Rochell. The earle according to his commission tooke the
sea with a fl&eacute;et of fortie ships prepared for him: but yer he could enter the hauen of
Rochell, he was assailed by an huge fl&eacute;et of Spaniards, and there vanquished, taken
prisoner, &amp; led into Spaine. The Spaniards had for capteins foure skilfull warriours,
Ambrose Bouquenegre, Cabesse de Vake or Vakadent, Dom Ferand du Pion, and
Rodigo de la Rochell, who had vnder their gouernement fortie great carrauels, and
thirt&eacute;ene trim barkes throughlie furnished and appointed with good mariners and men of
warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">These foure last remembered came forth of Rochell to aid the earle.</div>

<p>The earle of Penbroke had with him nothing the like number of ships, nor men: for
(as Froissard writeth) he had not past two and twentie knights with him, or (as other
haue) not past twelue, being for the more part of his owne retinue or houshold: and
yet those few Englishmen and Poictouins that were there with him, bare themselues right
valiantlie, and fought it out to the vttermost. There were slaine sir Simon Houssagre,
sir Iohn de Mortague, and sir Iohn Tuchet; and there were taken prisoners, besides the
earle himselfe, sir Robert Buffort, sir Iohn Curson, sir Othes de Grandson, sir Guichard
Dangle, the lord of Pinane, sir Iohn de Griueres, sir Iaques de Surgieres, the lord of
Tannaibouton, sir Iohn de Hardane, and others. This battell was fought on Midsummer
euen, in this six and fortith yeare of king Edwards reigne. The earle had (as Froissard
writeth) treasure with him, to haue waged thr&eacute;e thousand men of warre, which neuer
did anie man good, for (as he was informed) the ship wherein he was aboord, perished
with diuerse other being burnt or sunke. &para; The English writers saie, that it was no
maruell though this mishap chanced vnto him, bicause he had in parlement spoken against
men of the church, in giuing counsell that they might be constreined to paie gr&eacute;euous
subsidies, towards the maintenance of the kings warre, and that no lesse heauie paiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
and subsidies, should be imposed vpon them, than vpon the secular sort. Wherein he
s&eacute;emed to bewraie a malicious mind against the clergie, who as in no age they haue
wanted foes, so in his time they found few fr&eacute;ends, being a generation appointed and ordeined

had gathered eight hundred men of his owne souldiers togither, with them of the Ile, and
boldlie gaue battell to the Frenchmen: but in the end the Englishmen were discomfited,
and foure hundred of them slaine, so that sir Edmund Rous fled into the castell of Cornet,
&amp; was there besieged by the said Yuans, till the French king sent to him to come
backe from thence, and so he did, leauing the castell of Cornet, and sir Edmund Rous
within it as he found him. The Frenchmen this yeare recouered the citie of Poictiers,
Rochell also, and the most part of all Poictou, and finallie laid siege to Towars in Poictou,
wherein a great number of the lords of that countrie were inclosed, the which fell to a
composition with the Frenchmen to haue an abstinence of warre for themselues, and their
lands, till the feast of saint Michaell next insuing, which should be in the yeare 1362.
And in the meane time they sent to the king of England their souereigne lord, to certifie

rescuing Towars came, he nor anie of his sonnes could appeare in those parts, and so to
his great displeasure he returned home, and licenced all his people to depart to their

the lords Clisson and de la Vale, with the vicount of Roan, and other the lords and

winning of them. At Roy in Vermandois, they rested them seuen daies, and at their
departure set fire on the towne, bicause they could not win the church which was kept
against them. From thence they drew towards Laon, and so marched forward, passing
the riuers of Ysare, Marne, Saine, and Yonne. The Frenchmen coasted them, but
durst not approch to giue them battell.</p>

<p>N&eacute;ere to Ribaumount, about 80 Englishmen of sir Hugh Caluerlies band were distressed
by 120 Frenchmen: &amp; likewise beside Soissons, 120 English speares, or (as
other writers haue) fiftie speares, and twentie archers were vanquished by a Burgonian
knight called sir Iohn de Vienne that had with him thr&eacute;e hundred French speares. Of
more hurt by anie incounters I read not that the Englishmen susteined in this voiage.
For the Frenchmen kept them aloofe, and meant not to fight with their enemies, but
onelie to k&eacute;epe them from vittels, and fetching of forrage abroad, by reason whereof the
Englishmen lost manie horsses, and were in d&eacute;ed driuen to great scarsitie of vittels. When
they had passed the riuer of Loire, and were come into the countrie of Berrie, they vnderstood
how the Frenchmen laid themselues in sundrie ambushes to distresse them, if
they might espie the aduantage: but the duke of Lancaster placing his light horssemen,
with part of the archers in the fore ward, and in the battell the whole force of his footmen
with the men at armes, diuided into wings to couer that battell, wherein he himselfe
was, the residue of the horssemen with the rest of the archers he appointed to the
rereward, and so causing them to k&eacute;epe close togither, marched foorth till he came into
Poictou, &amp; then in reuenge of the Poictouins that had reuolted from the English obeisance,
he began a new spoile, killing the people, wasting the countrie, and burning the
houses and buildings euerie where as he passed, &amp; so finallie about Christmasse came to

<p>Whilest the duke of Lancaster was thus passing through the realme of France, pope

legats from him, to treat for a peace betwixt the realms of England and France. They
rode to &amp; fro betwixt the French king and his brethren, and the duke of Lancaster: but
the duke and the Englishmen kept on their waie, and so finallie k&eacute;eping forwards about

hard, that no reasonable offers would be taken. The two dukes of Lancaster and Britaine
laie in Burdeaux all the residue of the winter, and the Lent following. The same
yeare that the duke of Lancaster made this iournie thorough France, the king of England
sent certeine ambassadors to the pope, requiring him not to meddle with the reseruations
of benefices within his realme of England, but that those which were elected bishops
might enioy their s&eacute;es, and be confirmed of their metropolitaine and archbishop, as of

meaning, in those articles and other touching him and his realme. Also this yeare it was
decr&eacute;ed in parlement, that cathedrall churches might inioy the right of their elections,
and that the king should not hinder them that were chosen, but rather helpe them to their
confirmations. &para; In the same parlement was granted to the king a disme of the cleargie,
and a fift&eacute;enth of the laitie. &para; Moreouer at the sute of the popes legats, a respit of war
was granted betwixt the kings of England and France, but so that the Englishmen lost
in Gascoine a great number of castels and townes, by reason of a composition made
before, that if they were not rescued by the middest of August, they should then y&eacute;eld
themselues French: and bicause the truce was agr&eacute;ed vpon to indure till the last of
August, the Englishmen tooke no h&eacute;ed to the matter. It was further agr&eacute;ed vpon, that
in the beginning of September, there should m&eacute;et in the marches of Picardie, the duke
of Lancaster, and other of the English part, as commissioners to intreat of peace; and
the duke of Aniou and other on the French part, the popes legat to be there also as
mediator. When this agr&eacute;ement was thus accorded, the duke of Lancaster, and the

<p>This yeare the fifth of Iune, died William Wittelsey archbishop of Canturburie, after
whose death the moonks chose to that s&eacute;e the cardinall of Winchester, with which
election the king was nothing contented, so that after much monie spent by the moonks
to obteine their purpose, at length they were disappointed, and doctor Simon Sudberie
was admitted to that dignitie, who before was bishop of London, being the seauen and
fiftith archbishop that had ruled that s&eacute;e. He was chosen by the appointment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[Pg 701]</a></span>
king, and consent of the pope. For alredie was that decr&eacute;e worne out of vse, whereby
the elections of bishops haue rested in the voices of them of the cathedrall church: for
not onelie this Simon archbishop of Canturburie, but other also were ordeined bishops
from thencefoorth, by the will and authoritie of the popes and kings of this realme, till
at length it came to passe, that onelie the kings instituted bishops, and the bishops
ordeined other gouernours vnder them of meaner degr&eacute;es.</p>

<p>Thus the popes within a while lost all their authoritie, which they had before time within
this realme in the appointing of bishops, and other rulers of churches; and in like
manner also they lost shortlie after their authoritie of leuieng tenths of spirituall promotions,
the which they in former times had vsed, to the great detriment of the realme,

<p>About Candlemasse there met at Bruges as commissioners for the king of England,
the duke of Lancaster, the earle of Salisburie, and the bishop of London. For the
French king, the dukes of Aniou, and Burgognie, the earle of Salebruce, and the bishop
of Amiens with others. Finallie, when they could not agr&eacute;e vpon anie good conclusion
for peace, they accorded vpon a truce, to indure to the first of Maie next insuing in all

to be still in warre: by report of other writers, the truce was agr&eacute;ed vpon to continue till
the feast of All saints next insuing. About the same time that the foresaid commissioners
were at Bruges intreating of peace, the duke of Britaine did so much with his father in
law king Edward, that about the beginning of Aprill he sent ouer with him into Britaine
the earles of Cambridge, March, Warwike, and Stafford, the lord Spenser, sir Thomas
Holland, sir Nicholas Camois, sir Edward Twiford, sir Richard Ponchardon, sir Iohn
Lesselles, sir Thomas Grandson, sir Hugh Hastings, and diuerse other worthie capteins

<p>They landed at saint Matthews or Mahe de fine Poterne, where they tooke the castell

wan it likewise by force of assault, and then went to Brieu de Vaux, a towne stronglie
fensed, and well manned. In hope yet to win it, the duke of Britaine and the English
lords laid siege to it, but hearing that an English knight, one sir Iohn Deureux was
besieged in a fortresse which he had newlie made, by the vicount of Roan, the L. Clisson,
and other of the French part, they raised from Brieu de Vaux, and hasted forward to the
succor of sir Iohn Deureux, ernestlie wishing to find their enimies in the field, that they
might giue them battell: but the British lords hearing that the duke and the Englishmen
approched, made no longer abode, but got them with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Campellie a towne of
great strength not farre off, and therein closed themselues for their more safetie. The duke
of Britaine hearing that they were fled thither, followed them, and laid siege round about
the towne, inforcing himselfe to obteine the place, and so had doone in d&eacute;ed by all likelihood
verie shortlie, if at the same time, by reason of a truce taken for twelue moneths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[Pg 702]</a></span>
he had not b&eacute;ene commanded by the duke of Lancaster, without delaie to ceasse his war,
and breake vp his campe: as he did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Britaine disappointed by the truce.</div>

<p>There were sundrie m&eacute;etings of the commissioners for this treatie of peace, and still
they tooke longer time for continuance of the truce. And bicause that Britaine and all
the other countries of France (as should s&eacute;eme) were included in this truce, it s&eacute;emeth
that this was some second truce, and not the first truce, which included onelie the
marches of Calis, and those parts vp to the water of Some. But howsoeuer it was, the
duke of Britaine being in a great forwardnesse to haue recouered his duchie out of the
Frenchmens hands, and to haue reduced his rebellious subjects vnder due obeisance
againe, was now by this truce concluded out of time, greatlie disappointed, and so breake
vp his siege from before Campellie, and sent home the English armie. He went himselfe
to Aulroie, where his wife was; and taking order for the fortifieng and k&eacute;eping of those
places, which were in his possession, he came backe againe into England, and brought his
wife with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Sauiour le vicount y&eacute;elded.</div>

<p>A litle before the concluding of this truce, the Englishmen and others within the fortresse
of saint Sauiour le vicount, in the Ile or rather Close (as they called it) of Constantine,
which had b&eacute;ene long besieged, made a composition, that if they were not rescued
by a certeine daie, then should they y&eacute;eld vp the place to the Frenchmen. Now bicause
this truce was agr&eacute;ed before the daie appointed for the rescue of that place, with condition
that either part should inioy and hold that which at that present they had in possession,
during the terme of the truce; the Englishmen thought that saint Sauiour le
vicount should be saued by reason of that treatie: but the Frenchmen to the contrarie
auouched, that the first couenant ought to passe the last ordinance. So that when the
daie approched, the French king sent thither six thousand speares, knights, and esquiers,
beside other people: and bicause none appeared to giue them battell, they had the
towne deliuered to them.</p>

<p>&para; In this 49 yeare of K. Edwards reigne, a great death chanced in this land, and in
diuerse other countries, so that innumerable numbers of people died and perished of that
contagious sickenesse. Amongst other the lord Edward Spenser died the same yeare,
a man of great renowme and valiantnesse. Also the earle of Penbroke, hauing compounded
for his ransome, as he was vpon his returne from Spaine, comming homewards
through France, he fell sicke, and being brought in an horsselitter to Arras, he died there,
on the 16 daie of Aprill, leauing a sonne behind him not past two yeares of age, begot of
the countesse his wife called Anne, daughter vnto the lord Walter de Mannie. Polydor
mistaking the matter, saith that Marie the countesse of Penbroke, who builded Penbroke
hall in Cambridge, was wife to this Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke, whereas in d&eacute;ed
she was wife to his ancestor Aimer de Valence earle of Penbroke (as Iohn Stow in his
summarie hath trulie noted.) She was daughter to Guy earle of saint Pole, a worthie
ladie and a vertuous, tendering so much the wealthfull state of this land (a great part
wherof consisteth in the good bringing vp of youth, and training them to the knowledge
of learning) that for maintenance of students she began the forsaid commendable foundation,
about the yeare of Christ 1343, vpon a plot of ground that was hir owne, hauing purchased
licence thereto of the king, to whom she was of kin.</p>

<p>During that gr&eacute;euous mortalitie and cruell pestilence before remembered, the pope at
the instant request of the English cardinals, granted vnto all those that died in England,
being shriuen and repentant of their sinnes, cleane remission of the same, by two buls inclosed

commissioners againe at Bruges. There was with him the duke of Britaine, the earle of Salisburie,
and the bishop of London. For the French king there app&eacute;ered the duke of Burgognie,
the earle of Salebruch, and the bishop of Amiens. And at saint Omers laie the duke
of Aniou, the archbishop of Rauenna, and the bishop of Carpentras tooke great paine to
go to and fro betw&eacute;ene the parties: but they were sofar at ods in their demands, and as it
were of set purpose on the French behalfe, that no good could be doone betwixt them.
The French king required to haue Calis raced, and to haue againe fourt&eacute;ene hundred
thousand franks, which were paid for the ransome of king Iohn. The king of England
demanded to haue all the lands restored to him in Gascoigne and Guien cl&eacute;erelie exempt
of all resorts. So when nothing could be concluded touching a final peace, the truce was

<div class="sidenote">The lord Latimer. Dame Alice Perers. Sir Richard Sturrie. The request of the commons.</div>

<p>In this fiftith yeare, king Edward assembled his high court of parlement at Westminster,
in the which was demanded a subsidie of the commons for the defense of the kings
dominions against his enimies. Wherevnto answer was made by the common house, that
they might no longer beare such charges, considering the manifold burthens by them
sustained in time past. And further they said, it was well knowne the king was rich
inough to withstand his enimies, if his monie and treasure were well imploied: but the
land had b&eacute;ene of long time euill guided by euill officers, so that the same could not be
stored with chaffer, merchandize, or other riches. The commons also declared whom
they tooke and judged to be ch&eacute;efe causer of this disorder, as the duke of Lancaster, &amp;
the L. Latimer lord chamberleine to the king; also dame Alice Perers, whom the king
long time kept to his concubine; and also one named sir Richard Sturrie, by whose
sinister meanes and euill counsell the king was misled, and the land euill gouerned.
Wherefore the commons by the mouth of their speaker sir P&eacute;ers de la Mere, required
that those persons might be remooued from the king, and other more discr&eacute;et set in their
roomes about his person, and so put in authoritie, that they might s&eacute;e to his honour and
weale of the realme, more than the other had doone before them.</p>

<p>This request of the commons by support of the prince was allowed, and granted, so
that the said persons and other of their affinitie were commanded to depart the court, and
other (such as were thought m&eacute;et by the prince, and the sage p&eacute;eres of the realme) were
placed in their st&eacute;eds. &para; Shortlie after, the commons granted to the king his whole
request, so that he had of euerie person, man and woman, being aboue the age of fourt&eacute;ene
yeares, foure pence, poore people that liued of almesse onelie excepted. &para; Likewise
the cleargie granted, that of euerie beneficed man, the king should haue twelue
pence, and of euerie priest not beneficed foure pence (the foure orders of friers onelie
excepted.) But yer this monie could be leuied, the king was constreined to borrow certeine
great summes in sundrie places, and therefore he sent to the citie of London for
foure thousand pounds. And bicause Adam Staple the maior was not diligent in furthering
that lone, he was by the kings commandement discharged on the 22 daie of March,
and Richard Whitington mercer chosen in his place.</p>

procurer and setter forward of the dissention that rose in the armie, which vnder the lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[Pg 705]</a></span>ing
of sir Robert Knolles was sent into France. And when in that iournie he had lost most
of his men, and was escaped himselfe into England, he laid all the blame on sir Robert
Knolles, accusing him to the king of heinous treason; so as the king tooke no small displeasure
against the said sir Robert, insomuch that he durst not returne into England, till
he had pacified the kings wrath with monie, and that the knowne fidelitie of the man had
warranted him against the malicious and vntrue suggestions of his enimies. Wherevpon
the said Minsterworth perceiuing his craft to want the wished successe, he fled to the
French king, and conspiring with him to annoie the realme of England by bringing the
Spanish nauie to inuade the same, at length he was taken in the towne of Pampilona in
Nauarre, and brought backe into England, where he tasted the deserued fruit of his contriued
treason (as before y&eacute;e haue heard.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iohn Wiclife.</div>

<p>About this season, there rose in the vniuersitie of Oxenford a learned man Iohn Wiclife,
borne in the north parts, who being a secular pr&eacute;est, and a student in diuinitie, began to
propone certeine conclusions greatlie contrarie to the doctrine of the church in those daies
established, speciallie he argued against moonks, and other men of religion that inioied
great riches, and large possessions. There were diuerse that gaue good eare to him,
insomuch that sundrie learned men of that vniuersitie preached and set foorth the doctrine
that he taught. &para; Amongst other articles which they held, these were the ch&eacute;efe
and principall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ch&eacute;efest articles preached by Wiclife.</div>

<p>1 That the sacrament of the altar, after consecration, was not the bodie of Christ, but a
figure thereof.</p>

<p>2 That the church of Rome was no more head of the vniuersall church than any one
other, nor more authoritie was giuen by Christ vnto Peter, than to anie other of the apostles,
and that the pope had no more power in the keies of the church than anie other
pr&eacute;est whatsoeuer.</p>

<p>3 That temporall lords might both lawfullie and meritoriouslie take the temporall
goods and reuenues from the church, if it offended; and if anie temporall lord knew
the church to offend, he was bound vnder paine of damnation to take from it the temporalties.</p>

<p>4 That the gospell is sufficient in this life to direct by rule euerie christian man.</p>

<p>5 That all other rules of saints, vnder the obseruing whereof diuers religious doo liue,
ad no more perfection to the gospell, than washing ouer with lime dooth the wall.</p>

<p>6 That the pope, nor anie other prelat of the church, ought to haue anie prisons wherein
to punish offendors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wiclife &amp; his felowes mainteined by certeine lords.</div>

<p>These and manie other opinions did these men hold and mainteine, and diuerse lords
and great men of the land fauoured their cause. But when these conclusions were brought
before the pope, he condemned the number of 23 of those articles as vaine and hereticall,
directing his buls to the archbishop of Canturburie, and to the bishop of London, that they
should cause the said Wiclife to be apprehended, and examined vpon the said conclusions,
which they did in presence of the duke of Lancaster, and the lord Percie, and
hearing his declaration, commanded him to silence, and in no wise to deale with those
matters from thencefoorth, so that for a time, both he and his fellowes kept silence: but
after at the contemplation of diuerse of the temporall lords, they preached and set foorth
their doctrine againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Lancaster in danger by the Londoners.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Percie.</div>

<p>The same day that Wiclife was conuented thus at London, before the bishops and other
lords, thorough a word spoken in reproch by the duke of Lancaster vnto the bishop of
London, streightwaies the Londoners getting them to armour, meant to haue slaine the
duke, &amp; if the bishop had not staid them, they had suerlie set fire on the dukes house at the
Sauoie: and with much adoo might the bishop quiet them. Among other reprochfull
parts which in despite of the duke they committed, they caused his armes in the publike
str&eacute;et to be reuersed as if he had b&eacute;ene a traitor, or some notorious offender. The duke
and the lord Henrie Percie, whom the citizens sought in his owne house to haue slaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[Pg 706]</a></span>
him, if he had b&eacute;en found, hearing of this riotous stur and rebellious commotion, forsooke
their dinner and fled to Kenington, where the lord Richard, sonne to the prince, togither
with his mother then remained, exhibiting before their presence, a grieuous complaint
of the opprobrious iniuries doone vnto them, by the wilfull outrage of the Londoners.
For this and other causes, the citizens were sore hated of the duke, in so much that he
caused the maior &amp; aldermen that then ruled to be discharged of their roomes, and other
put in their places.</p>

<p>The king being more grieuouslie vexed with sickness from daie to daie, either increasing
by the course therof, or renewed by some new surfet, finallie this yeare departed out of this
transitorie life at his manour of Sh&eacute;ene, now called Richmond, the 21 daie of Iune, in the
yeare of our Lord 1377, after he had liued 65 yeares, &amp; reigned fiftie yeares, foure
moneths, &amp; 28 daies. His corpse was conueied from Sh&eacute;ene by his foure sonnes,
namelie Lionell duke of Clarence, Iohn of Gant duke of Lancaster, Edmund of Langlie
duke of Yorke, and Thomas of Woodstoke earle of Cambridge, with other nobles of the
realme, and solemnelie interred within Westminster church, with this epitaph in his
memoriall:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">His issue.</div>

<p>He had issue by his wife qu&eacute;ene Philip 7 sonnes, Edward prince of Wales, William of Hatfield
that died yoong, Lionell duke of Clarence, Iohn of Gant duke of Lancaster, Edmund
of Langlie earle of Cambridge &amp; after created duke of Yorke, Thomas of Woodstoke erle
of Buckingham after made duke of Glocester, and an other William which died likewise
yoong. He had also thr&eacute;e daughters, Marie that was maried to Iohn of Mountford duke
of Britaine, Isabell wedded to the lord Coucie earle of Bedford, and Margaret coupled in
mariage with the earle of Penbroke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His praise.</div>

<div class="sidenote">His proportion of bodie.</div>

<p>This king, besides other his gifts of nature, was aided greatlie by his s&eacute;emelie personage.
He had a prouident wit, sharpe to conceiue and vnderstand: he was courteous and gentle,
dooing all things sagelie and with good consideration, a man of great temperance and
sobrietie. Those he chiefelie fauoured and aduanced to honour, and roomes of high dignitie,
which excelled in honest conuersation, modestie, and innocencie of life, of bodie well
made, of a conuenient stature, as neither of the highest nor lowest sort: of face faire and
manlike, eies bright and shining, and in age bald, but so as it was rather a s&eacute;emelinesse
to those his ancient yeares than any disfiguring to his visage; in knowledge of martiall
affaires verie skilfull, as the enterprises and worthie acts by him atchiued doo sufficientlie
witnesse.</p>

<p>In what estimation he was had among strangers it may appeare, in that he was not
onelie made vicar of the empire by the emperour Lewes of Bauiere, but also after the
decease of the same emperour, diuerse of the electours, as Lewes marques of Brandenbourgh,
Robert or Rupert count Palatine of the Rhene, and the yoong duke of Saxonie,
with Henrie archbishop of Mentz, elected him to succ&eacute;ed in place of the said emperour
Lewes. Neuerthelesse, he giuing them hartie thanks for the honour which they did vnto
him herein, refused to take the charge vpon him, alledging that he could not haue time to
supplie the roome, by reason of the warres that he had in France, to recouer his right which
he had to that realme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Prosperitie vnstable.</div>

<p>This is noted by writers to be a token of great wisedome in this noble king, that would
not go about to catch more than he might well gripe. Examples of bountious liberalitie,
and great clemencie he shewed manie, and the same verie notable; so that in maner he
alone amongst all other kings was found to be one, subiect to none, or at the least, to verie
light and small faults. But yet he was not void of euill haps: for whereas, during the
terme of fortie yeares space he reigned in high felicitie, and as one happie in all his
dooings: so in the rest of his time that followed, he felt a wonderfull change in fortune
(whom writers compare to the moone for hir variablenesse, and often alterations, as neuer
at a staie, saieng,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vultus fortun&aelig; variatur imagine lun&aelig;,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>shewing hirselfe froward to him in most part of his proc&eacute;edings: for such is the state of
this world, seldome dooth prosperitie continue, and guide the sterne of our worldlie
dooings, as it well appeared by this noble prince. For in the first yeares of his reigne,
after he once began to gouerne of himselfe, he recouered that which had b&eacute;ene lost in
Scotland, by great victories obteined against his aduersaries in that land, and passed further
into the same, than euer his grandfather king Edward the first had doone before him,
subduing the countrie on each hand, so that he placed gouernors, and bestowed offices,
lands, and liuings in that realme at his pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Iohn Stow</i> vpon conference referreth this to the last yeare of king Edward the first.</div>

<p>&para; Amongst other (as I remember) there is yet remaining a charter vnder his great
seale conteining a grant made vnto Iohn Eure and his heires for his good seruice doone
in those parts, of a manour called Ketnes in the countie of Forfar (which lieth in the north
of Scotland) with a market euerie mondaie, and a faire for thr&eacute;e daies togither at Michaelmasse,
as the euen, the daie, and the morrow after. Also he granted to the same Iohn
Eure, fr&eacute;e warren thoroughout the same lordship. This Iohn Eure was ancestor vnto the
lord Eure that now liueth, who hath the same charter in his possession. &para; As for this
kings victories in France, the same were such as might s&eacute;eme incredible, if the consent of
all writers in that age confirmed not the same. But as these victories were glorious, so
yet they prooued not so profitable in the end: for whereas he had sore burdened his
subiects with taskes and subsidies, at length they waxed wearie, and began to withdraw
their forward minds to helpe him with such summes as had b&eacute;ene requisit for the maintenance
of the warres, which the Frenchmen prolonged of purpose, and refused to trie
their fortune any more in pight fields, wherby when he was constreined to be at continuall
charges in such lingering warres, to defend that which he had erst gotten by force, and
couenants of the peace; the sinewes of warre, to wit monie, began to faile him, and so
the enimies recouered a great part of that which before time they had lost, both on the
further side the seas, and likewise in Scotland.</p>

<p>This must n&eacute;eds be a great gr&eacute;efe vnto a prince of such a stout and valiant stomach,
namelie sith he had b&eacute;ene so long time before accustomed to find fortune still so fauourable
vnto him in all his enterprises. But finallie the thing that most gr&eacute;eued him, was
the losse of that most noble gentleman, his d&eacute;ere sonne prince Edward, in whom was
found all parts that might be wished in a worthie gouernour. But this and other mishaps
that chanced to him now in his old yeares, might s&eacute;eme to come to passe for a
reuenge of his disobedience shewed to his father in vsurping against him, although it might
be said, that he did it by constraint, and through the aduise of others. But whether remorse
hereof, or of his other offenses mooued him, it may s&eacute;eme (as some write) that the
the consideration of this worlds mutabilitie, which he tried to the full, caused him (as is
thought) to haue in mind the life in the world to come, and therefore of a pure deuotion
founded the church and colledge of saint Stephan at Westminster, and another at Cambridge
called The Kings hall, giuing therevnto lands and reuenues, to the maintenance of
them that would giue themselues vnto learning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mines of gold &amp; siluer.</div>

<p>Towards the maintenance of his warres, and furnishing foorth of such other charges
and expenses as he tooke in hand to beare out, he had some helpe by the siluer mines in
Deuonshire and Cornewall, in like manner as his grandfather king Edward the first had.
For one Matthew Crowthorne k&eacute;eper of his mines in those parts, y&eacute;elded diuerse accounts
of the issues and profits of the same, betw&eacute;ene the second and fift&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne,
as well for the siluer as for the lead, after the siluer was fined from it. Also Iohn Moneron
succ&eacute;eding in the same office, accomptant of the profits of the same mines, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span>
Michaelmasse in the ninet&eacute;enth yeare of his reigne, vnto the second of Nouember in the
thr&eacute;e and twentith yeare, y&eacute;elded vpon his accounts, both the siluer and the lead thereof
remaining. Moreouer he let by indenture in the two and thirtith yeare of his reigne,
vnto Iohn Ballancer, and Walter Goldbeater, his mines of gold, siluer, and copper, in the
countie of Deuonshire, for terme of years. There is an account thereof remaining, and
by the same (as it appeareth) was answered for the first yeare twentie markes. The
second yeare the patent&eacute;es died, and the king then disposed the same to others. In the
eight and twentith yeare of his reigne, he committed by indenture his said mines in
Deuonshire, to one maister Iohn Hanner, and one Herman Rainesthorpe of Boheme,
minors, y&eacute;elding to the king the tenth part of the oare, as well of the gold and siluer, as of
the lead and copper that should be gotten foorth of the said mines.</p>

<p>In this kings daies, there liued manie excellent men, both in learning, in vertue, and in
martiall prowesse, as partlie is touched in this discourse of his reigne; and first, the said
noble and most valiant king, the prince of Wales his sonne surnamed the blacke prince,
the duke of Lancaster Iohn of Gant sonne to the king, and his father in law duke Henrie,
Edmund earle of Cambridge, and after duke of Yorke; the earles of Warwike, Huntington,
Salisburie, Stafford, Northampton, Arundell and others; the lord Reginald Cobham,
the lord Basset, the lord Thomas Holland, the lord Walter de Mannie and Henuier, the
lord Edward Spenser, the lord Iohn Chandois, the lord Iames Audeley, sir Iohn Copland,
sir Thomas Felton, sir Robert Knolles, who (as I haue said) being born in Cheshire
of meane parentage, through his manlie prowesse, and most skilfull experience in the
warres, grew to be right famous.</p>

<p>Moreouer, sir Hugh Caluerlie borne in the same shire, the capitall de Beufe a Gascoigne,
sir Thomas Percie, sir Hugh Hastings, sir Baldwine Freuill, sir Iohn Harleston,
sir Iames Pipe, sir Thomas Dagworth, &amp; that valiant English knight sir Iohn Hawkewood,
whose fame in the parts of Italie shall remaine for euer, where (as their histories make
mention) he grew to such estimation for his valiant atchiued enterprises, that happie
might that prince or common-wealth accompt themselues, that might haue his seruice,
and so liuing there in such reputation, sometimes he serued the pope, somtimes the lords
of Millane, now this prince or common-wealth, now that, and other whiles none at all,
but taking one towne or other, would k&eacute;epe the same, till some liking enterteinment were
offered, and then would he sell such a towne, where he had thus remained, to them that
would giue him for it according to his mind. Barnabe lord of Millane gaue vnto him one
of his base daughters in marriage, with an honorable portion for hir dower.</p>

<p>This man was borne in Essex (as some write) who at the first became a tailor in London,
&amp; afterwards going to the warres in France, serued in the roome of an archer, but at
length he became a capteine and leader of men of war, highlie commended and liked of
amongst the souldiers, in so much that, when by the peace concluded at Bretignie, in the
yeare 1360, great numbers of soldiers were discharged out of wages, they got themselues
togither in companies, and without commandement of any prince, by whose authoritie they
might make warre, they fell to of themselues, and sore harried and spoiled diuerse countries
in the realme of France, as partlie y&eacute;e haue heard: amongst whome this sir Iohn
Hawkewood was one of the principall capteins, &amp; at length went into Italie, to serue
the marques of Montferrato, against the duke of Millane; although I remember that
some write, how he came into that countrie with the duke of Clarance, but I thinke the
former report be true: but it may well be, that he was readie to attend the said duke at
his comming into Italie. And thus much concerning such famous capteins as serued this
noble king Edward the third, although for br&eacute;efeness I passe ouer diuerse other, no lesse
famous and worthie for their high manhood and tried valiancie to be remembred, than
these afore mentioned.</p>

<p>Of learned men, these we find by Iohn Bale registered in the Centuries; Iohn Baconthrop
borne in Blackney in Northfolke, a frier Carmelite, and prouinciall of his order, so excellentlie
learned, as well in diuinitie, as in both the ciuill and canon lawes, that he proc&eacute;ed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[Pg 709]</a></span>ed

Triuet borne in Northfolke, sonne to sir Thomas Triuet knight, &amp; one of the kings

schooles abroad beyond the seas, in France and Germanie, &amp; afterwards for his wisedome,
good demeanor, &amp; learning, he was reteined with the bishop of Vlmes in Suabenland,
a region in high Germanie.</p>

<p>Amongst other treatises which he compiled, being manie, and namelie of naturall philosophie,
he wrote a commentarie of the ethikes of Aristotle, and dedicated the same vnto
the said bishop, a worke which hath b&eacute;ene highlie est&eacute;emed, not onelie in the Vniuersities
of Italie, Germanie and France, but also here in our Vniuersities of England. To
conclude, such was the fame of this doctor Burlie, that when the ladie Philip, daughter to
the earle of Heinault should come ouer into England to be married to king Edward, this
doctor Burlie was reteined by hir, and appointed to be hir almoner, and so continued in
great estimation, in so much that after Edward prince of Wales, eldest sonne to king Edward
commonlie called the blacke prince, was borne, and able to learne his booke, the said
Burlie among other was commanded to be one of his instructors.</p>

<p>By reason hereof, sir Simon Burlie, of whom I haue made some mention heretofore in
this kings life, and more intend to speake, as occasion serueth in the next king, being sonne
to sir Iohn Burlie, n&eacute;ere kinsman to the said doctor Burlie, was admitted among other
yoong gentlemen, to be schoolefelow with the said prince, by occasion whereof he
grew in such credit and fauour with the said prince, that afterwards when his son
Richard of Burdeaux, that succ&eacute;eded king Edward his father, was borne, the said
prince for special trust and confidence which he had in the said sir Simon Burlie, committed
the gouernance &amp; education of his son the said Richard vnto him, whereby he was
euer after highlie in fauour with the said Richard, and no lesse aduanced by him, when he
came to inioy the crowne of this realme.</p>
